Or, technically speaking, in the mind. They say 'misery loves company', but they never offer an explanation as to why that is. Schadenfreude, it's called. Brings to mind a song from the early 80s by Don Henley.

> "I make my living off the evening news<br>
> Just give me something, something I can use<br>
> People love it when you lose<br>
> They love dirty laundry<br>

> Dirty little secrets, dirty little lies<br>
> We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pies<br>
> We love to cut you down to size<br>
> We love dirty laundry<br>

> We can do "The Innuendo", we can dance and sing<br>
> When it's said and done we haven't told you a thing<br>
> We all know that crap is king<br>
> Give us dirty laundry!"<br>

Is it a competitive thing? In Japan, there's an expression "ashi o hipparu", which translates literally to "pull one's leg", but unlike the English meaning, in Japan it means to trip someone up, hold them back, or cramp their style. Show me someone successful, and I'll show you someone with a lot to lose, and a skeleton or two to be dug up. And, I don't have to do it myself; I can just go online one evening and post the question on the timeline of my preferred social media platform: "What's this person hiding? Anyone know?"<br>
I'm sure by the time I wake up, I'll know something.
