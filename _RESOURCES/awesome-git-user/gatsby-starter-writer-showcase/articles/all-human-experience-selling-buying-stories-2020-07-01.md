“Who controls the past controls the future.<br> Who controls the present controls the past.”<br> – George Orwell, 1984<br>

The battle for the narrative is eternal. Power is everything, weakness is voicelessness. But, what are you hoping to give voice to? “They want to erase our history!” someone cries. “Your history erased someone else’s history!” comes the retort.

Each of us wants to tell a personal story. A story which may or may not seem coherent if two of that person's life events, separated by some arbitrary amount of time, are considered side by side. Yet, when you retreat into yourself (insofar as that’s possible), all of your reflections of experience seem to be strung together in a meaningful way, which gives rise to a sense of continuing personal identity. Certainly, your sense of identity is real. However, the notion that that perceived identity is objectively real, is nonsense. Subjectively, your story makes more sense in hindsight than it does in real time. Think about it; when something terrible happens to you, something painful,... in the moment you think, “Get me out of here, take this suffering away… I don’t belong here, I don’t deserve this. I don’t want this!” You may not articulate it that way, but the gist of what you think in such moments is captured in these statements. However, later, when all is said and done, you think, “The terrible things that have happened to me, they’ve made me who I am today. It’s the hardest times that really define you.”
Statements like these make the notion of continuing personal identity seem absurd.

In almost any given moment, your sense of identity can seem quite real, yet in a trauma-inducing moment, that sense fades quickly. Certainly, if a sadistic person were torturing you right now, you wouldn’t say, “Yeah, keep doing that thing that’s going to define future me!” You’d scream, “No! Stop!” And, if your torturer said, “Come on, pull yourself together. Don’t you want to be the person this experience will make you?” “No,” you say. “Fuck that person!”

So, who are you?
Or more aptly put, what are you?

You, in essence, are a story-making machine. First you make a story about yourself for yourself, and then you try to make a story about yourself for others. But, they themselves are story-making machines. And, not only do they storify their own lives, they storify yours as well. If the story you tell them about yourself differs too much from the one they tell themselves about you, they’ll either call bullshit, or just walk away.

The collective story told about a society’s existence, its history, if you will, may not sit well in the minds of some of its members. But, if it doesn’t cause too much cognitive dissonance with the majority, the story will stick. For awhile, anyway.

In your society, for decades now, some voices have strongly cried out against the accepted narrative, feeling that the stories they find themselves in aren’t reflected accurately in the societal narrative, and that the direction of the story doesn’t seem to be leading to a positive place for them. No longer willing to accept what they have sometimes been taught was their lot in life (in many cases by elders in their communities), they wrestle for control of the narrative. And, the majority is shocked, becoming fully aware that what they thought was their history was just a collective delusion propagated through textbooks and culture. However, they know a radical change in the story line will leave them with a loss of that sense of identity they’ve always carried with them. So, they fight to keep the status quo while the world burns around them. They demonize the others and are in turn demonized by them.
And, through all of the self-delusion, a primitive echo reverberates in all of their hearts. Were it articulated, it would amount to, “There’s your story and there’s my story. My story vs. your story. Me vs. you.”

To advance the narrative, you must condemn. Condemn the other. Condemn yourself if it wins you allies. Condemn your children to participate in a game they couldn’t have chosen to play.

And the story goes on...
