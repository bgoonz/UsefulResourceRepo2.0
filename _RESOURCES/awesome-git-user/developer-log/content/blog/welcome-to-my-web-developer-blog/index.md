This blog template is made from an official Gatsby starter. In fact, I created that starter, and it's my first official contribution to GatsbyJS. If you'd like to use it, visit the official Gatsby Starter Library, click 'source', and clone it. Then, of course, tweak it to your heart's desire. Whether you're a professional web developer or are just getting started in the world of web development, that Gatsby starter is ready to go, right out the of box. Its minimalist design makes it easy to tailor to your needs. But, you'll definitely want to make use of the tech tags and developer social media links, and maybe even make some of your own.<br>
