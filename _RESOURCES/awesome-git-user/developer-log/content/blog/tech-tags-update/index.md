I've updated the tech tags for my _Developer Diary_ Gatsby starter to use svg instead of Font Awesome icons. The main reason was to eliminate the Font Awesome dependency, and a secondary reason is that Font Awesome just doesn't have enough icons. I've also added a _GraphQL_ tag, which I think looks pretty good.

I'm going to restrict the update to this site for now, and after it seems like nothing will break, I'll add the change to the official Gatsby starter.
