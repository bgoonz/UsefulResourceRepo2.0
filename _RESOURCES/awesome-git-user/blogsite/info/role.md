**Current Role**<br>
Currently working as a web developer for a niche importer/retailer with a primary focus on maintaining and improving the company's e-commerce site. In addition to that, I build websites for companies whose products we import in order to help them market their products here in Japan. I mostly work within the JavaScript ecosystem, but work with Python and PHP on occasion.
