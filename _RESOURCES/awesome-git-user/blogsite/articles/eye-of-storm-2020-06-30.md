After being so busy at work doing web development, I've focused my efforts in that direction almost exclusively for the last year and a half. It's time to turn back to math and science. To that end, I'm doing a couple of stats and probability courses at edX to clear out the cobwebs and refresh my memory. I've forgotten how much I enjoy even the basic stuff. Look for stats and probability posts in the near future.
