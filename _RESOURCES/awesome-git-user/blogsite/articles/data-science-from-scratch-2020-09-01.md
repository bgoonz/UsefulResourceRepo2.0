I received some more bookstore gift certificates, so I went ahead and picked up a copy of the second edition of _Data Science From Scratch_ by Joel Grus. Apparently, it gives the beginner a chance to jump into data science without going right to the big libraries Pandas and scikit-learn, so I figured it was worth the money and the time since I'm a first-principles kind of guy.
