<p><strong>Change Return Program</strong> - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.</p>
<p><strong>Binary to Decimal and Back Converter</strong> - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>Calculator</strong> - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more)</strong> - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.</p>
<p><strong>Alarm Clock</strong> - A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.</p>

<p><strong>Happy Numbers</strong> - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Number Names</strong> - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language’s default bounded integer type, if that’s less). <em>Optional: Support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers).</em></p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p><strong>Caesar cipher</strong> - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts “HI” to “JK”, but key 20 encrypts “HI” to “BC”. This simple “monoalphabetic substitution cipher” provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.</p>
