# Regular Expressions 

Regular expressions are a delight and a nightmare. They please and they
confound. They are an important part of every developer's toolbox. By the time
you finish this, you should be able to

* Define the effect of the * operator and use it in a regular expression
* Define the effect of the ? operator and use it in a regular expression
* Define the effect of the + operator and use it in a regular expression
* Define the effect of the . operator and use it in a regular expression
* Define the effect of the ^ operator and use it in a regular expression
* Define the effect of the $ operator and use it in a regular expression
* Define the effect of the [] bracket expression and use it in a regular
  expression
* Define the effect of the - inside brackets and use it in a regular expression
* Define the effect of the ^ inside brackets and use it in a regular expression

# HTTP Full-Stack 

Understanding how Node.js handles incoming HTTP requests using the
`IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` objects provide a strong foundation of
being able to predict problems when you use frameworks to ease the burden of
writing Web applications. When you complete the associated material for this
lesson, you should be able to:

* Identify the five parts of a URL
* Identify at least three protocols handled by the browser
* Use an `IncomingMessage` object to
  * access the headers sent by a client (like a Web browser) as part of the HTTP
    request
  * access the HTTP method of the request
  * access the path of the request
  * access and read the stream of content for requests that have a body
* Use a `ServerResponse` object to
  * write the status code, message, and headers for an HTTP response
  * write the content of the body of the response
  * properly end the response to indicate to the client (like a Web browser)
    that all content has been written

# The Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

We use URLs all the time. Now, it's time to really understand how they work.

From this reading, you should be able to

* Recall where to find the definition of a URL,
* Identify and recall the five components of a URL, and
* Identify properly formatted URLs

## The specification

Almost all good things that define how the Internet works has one or more things
called IETF RFCs which define how they work. There are two acronyms there:

* **IETF**: Internet Engineering Task Force
* **RFC**: Request For Comments

The IETF is an open standards organization that creates voluntary standards to
maintain and improve the usability and interoperability of the Internet. Things
like the way travels across the Internet is created an maintained by the IETF.
In particular, the _Simple Mail Transfer Protocol_ is now governed by [RFC
5321]. RFC 5321 made obsolete RFC 2821 which, in turn, made obsolete RFC 821.
The IETF is always working to make the Internet better with respect to its
growth and usage.

An RFC is a document usually created by programmers, engineers, and scientists
in the form of a memorandum. They publish the RFC for peer review. When enough
people have reviewed it, and it seems worthy of adoption, the IETF will change
its status to "Internet Standard" which means that everyone should comply with
it if they implement that standard.

The [RFC 3986], _Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax_, is an
"Internet Standard". That means that software applications that use URLs need to
conform to the specification found in that document lest they be publicly shamed
by computer programmers trying to use the non-conforming software.

## What is this "resource" thing?

Well, the standard doesn't do much for you in providing a definition of this
word "resource".

> This specification does not limit the scope of what might be a resource;
> rather, the term "resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be
> identified by a URI. Familiar examples include an electronic document, an
> image, a source of information with a consistent purpose (e.g., "today's
> weather report for Los Angeles"), a service (e.g., an HTTP-to-SMS gateway),
> and a collection of other resources. A resource is not necessarily accessible
> via the Internet; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound books in a
> library can also be resources. Likewise, abstract concepts can be resources,
> such as the operators and operands of a mathematical equation, the types of a
> relationship (e.g., "parent" or "employee"), or numeric values (e.g., zero,
> one, and infinity).

That influence comes from one of the authors, Dr. Roy Fielding. He has some
strong ideas about how the Internet works and, much to his disappointment, it
continues to move away from his ideals.

For your purposes, a URL points to a (hopefully) accessible resource that can
be accessed, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and pure data in the form of JSON.

## The components of a URL

In Section 3, _Syntax Components_, of RFC 3986 contains this helpful ASCII art
graphic to show you the components of a URL.

```
  foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
  \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
   |           |            |            |        |
scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
```

Here's an explanation of each of those components.

### The "scheme" of a URL

This section used to be called "the protocol", but was updated when URLs became
part of a larger family known as URIs, Uniform Resource Identifiers, which is
what RFC 3986 actually covers.

You've actually used three schemes already in class! Can you remember them?

If you replied "http" and "https", that's right! When you type an authority in
the browser, like "duckduckgo.com" or "localhost:3000", the browser _assumes_ that
you want to use HTTP, so it prepends that scheme to the authority. The browser
would then make requests to "http://duckduckgo.com" or "http://localhost:3000".

When you double click on an HTML file and it opens locally in your browser, that
is using the "file" scheme, meaning that it is looking for a file local to the
computer! You've done this countless times during this course. You may have
noticed the "file" part in the address bar. That's the scheme it used to access
local files as opposed to making an HTTP request.

This is why it was once named "protocol", because it was the protocol that the
browser would use to _locate the resource_ using a Uniform Resource Locator.

### Stuff between the scheme and authority

The standard tells us that for URLs that have an authority, the characters "://"
must exist between the scheme and the authority. That's why you have to type
those characters. You can blame Sir Tim Berners-Lee for that because he defined
it in the original RFC for this subject, RFC 1738, _Uniform Resource Locators
(URL)_.

### The authority

This part of as URL is normally the domain name of the resource that has the
resource that you're trying to access.

Sometimes it has a port number, too, like when you start a local HTTP server
with Node.js. Then, you type "http://localhost:3000". The authority is the
entire "localhost:3000". That means that, even if "http://localhost:3000" and
"http://localhost:8081" return the exact same content, they're considered to be
two different URLs to the same content.

### The path

Paths are in the first part of an HTTP request, if you recall. When you click on
a link in your browser that takes you to "https://duckduckgo.com/about", that
results in an HTTP request that begins with the following line:

```
GET /about HTTP/1.1
```

That's the path.

If the path is omitted from a URL, it is assumed to be "/".

### The query

This is extra information sent to the browser meant for the processing of the
request. For example, when you go to DuckDuckGo and perform a search for "RFC
3986" by typing it into the search box, the URL that your browser is directed to
reads "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=RFC+3986".

The question mark and everything that comes after it (up to the _fragment_) is
considered the "query" of the URL. Because it's part of the URL, it means that
different values of the query part of the URL points to different resources even
if the exact same content is returned.

With respect to URLs used for the World Wide Web, queries generated by browsers
(and possibly by your code) will have the following format:

* Entries in the query are "URL encoded" key-value pairs with an equal sign
  between them
* Entries are concatenated with the ampersand symbol

When the key or value of an entry in a query contains a character that is not
one of the reserved or unreserved characters, then it gets "URL encoded". That
process replaces each character a percent sign and its hexadecimal [ASCII Code].

For example, when your provide the value "Mary$quite/contrary" for your query
in DuckDuckGo, the browser "URL encodes" the "$" and "/" because those
aren't allowable characters. Those characters' ASCII Code values are 24 and 2F,
respectively. That transforms the string to "Mary%24quite%2Fcontrary".

Luckily, JavaScript has built-in methods called `encodeURI` ([link][link to
encodeURI]) and `decodeURI` ([link][link to decodeURI]) that handles that transformation for you!

### The fragment

The fragment is never sent to the server. Instead, it tells the browser to
access a specific section of the page after it loads. For example, if you look
at the following link

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Protocol-relative_URLs

you can see that there is a fragment value of "#Protocol-relative_URLs". If you
click on that link, the browser will load that page and, then, scroll that
section into view for you.

Unlike with changing values in _any_ of the other sections, if you change the
value in the fragment, the browser will _not_ reload the page.

## Reading RFCs

Unfortunately, RFCs tend to be very unappealing and technical, not fun to read
at all. However, you should try reading them when you have a question about how
something works that's governed by the IETF. You will gain insight that only
comes from technical documentation.

As a side note, it is a common thing for programmers to publish April Fool's
RFCs. Their sense of humor is ... shockingly technical and dry. Here are some
interesting ones, for example.

* [Hypertext Jeopardy Protocol (HTJP/1.0)]
* [Design Considerations for Faster-Than-Light (FTL) Communication]
* [TCP Option to Denote Packet Mood]

Yep, that's the kind of humor in deeply computer science-y groups.

¯\\(◉◡◔)/¯

## What you've learned

You learned that the five parts of a URL are

1. The scheme (required),
2. The authority (required),
3. The path (optional),
4. The query (optional), and
5. The fragment (optional, not sent to the server).

You were reminded that you actually know three schemes: http, https, and file.

And, that's it for URLs. :-)

# Regular Expressions Cheat Sheet

This article lists the most commonly-used regular expressions operators. You
can use it as a handy reference for later while you write regular expressions.


## The * operator

The `*` operator is known as the **Kleene Star**, one of the [Kleene operators]. 
You use the Kleene Star operator to match any number, **zero or more**, of the 
character it follows.

For example, take the following regular expression patterns and compare them 
with the strings below:

#### Example 1: `xy*z`

Matches:
```
xxz
xyyyzzz
```

Does not match:
```
yyy
xyxz
```

#### Example 2: `x*yz`

Matches:
```
xxyz
yyyzzz
```

Does not match:
```
xxx
xyyz
```

#### Example 3: `xyz*`

Matches:
```
xy
xxyzzz
```

Does not match:
```
zzz
xyyz
```


## The ? operator

The question mark operator denotes that the character preceding `?` is an 
[optional character]. Note that when you want to use a normal question mark as a 
normal character and NOT as a regular expression operator, you need to escape 
the character with a forward slash like `\?`.

Take the following pattern and compare it with the strings below. Notice how 
the `s?` portion of the expression makes the "s" character optional, allowing 
the pattern to match both "video" and "videos".

#### Example 1: `videos?`

Matches:
```
cat video
dog videos
```

Does not match:
```
bird vids
hedgehog vides
```

#### Example 2: `videos\?`

Matches:
```
dog videos?
videos? hello?
```

Does not match:
```
cat video
videos
```

Note different effect of the regular expression with an escaped question mark 
verses a non-escaped question mark.

#### Example 3: `videos? watched\?`

Matches:
```
dog video watched?
cat videos watched?
```

Does not match:
```
bird video watched
hedgehog videos not watched
```


## The + operator

The `+` operator is known as the **Kleene Star Plus**. You use Kleene Star Plus 
to match **one or more** of the character it follows, instead of **zero or more** 
like the Kleene Star. 

For example, take the following regular expression patterns and strings below:

#### Example 1: `xy+z`

Matches:
```
xyyyzzz
xxxyzz
```

Does not match:
```
xxz
xyxz
```

Note how "xxz" is matched by `xy*z` but not by `xy+z`.

#### Example 2: `x+yz`

Matches:
```
xyzzz
xxxyzz
```

Does not match:
```
yzz
xyyz
```

#### Example 3: `xyz+`

Matches:
```
xyzzz
xxyz
```

Does not match:
```
xy
xxy
```


## The . operator

The dot operator matches any **single** character. It acts as a [wildcard] that 
can match any single number, letter, symbol, or even whitespace. Like the 
question mark operator, in order to use `.` as a normal character instead of a 
regular expression operator, you need to escape the character with a forward 
slash (`\.`).

Take the example expressions and strings below:

#### Example 1: `..a..`

Matches:
```
12aa3
brains
```

Does not match:
```
123a4
catch
``` 

#### Example 2: `.at.`

Matches:
```
?att
catch
```

Does not match:
```
1a1t
atss
``` 

Remember that using a forward slash before a question mark in a regular 
expression escapes the question mark so that `?` is not interpreted as a 
regular expression operator.

#### Example 3: `...\?`

Matches:
```
123?
????
```

Does not match:
```
123
?cat
``` 


## The ^ operator without brackets

The `^` operator is known as the hat operator. The hat operator can be used in 
two ways:
* Without square brackets to match the start of a line.
* Within square brackets to denote when you want to exclude characters.

When using `^` at the beginning of a regular expression pattern, you are 
indicating a match with statements that begin with the characters in your 
pattern. Note the case sensitivity in the examples below.

#### Example 1: `^Dog`

Matches:
```
Doggie daycare
Dog food
```

Does not match:
```
doG master
puppy Dog
``` 

#### Example 2: `^dog`

Matches:
```
doggie
dogs
```

Does not match:
```
hotdog
small dog
``` 

#### Example 3: `^\?`

Matches:
```
? hello
???
```

Does not match:
```
hi?
\?bye
``` 


## The $ operator

The dollar sign operator is used to define the end of a line. Like how the `^` 
hat operator is used to specifically match the beginning characters of a line, 
the `$` dollar sign operator is used to specifically match the end of a line. 

Take the following patterns and strings below:

#### Example 1: `smell$`

Matches:
```
doggie smell
doggie has an interesting smell
```

Does not match:
```
doggie smells
doggie is smelling
``` 

#### Example 2: `dog.$`

Matches:
```
sit, dog.
good dog!
```

Does not match:
```
sit, doggie
dogs.
``` 

In the example below, the hat and dollar sign operators are used together to 
create a pattern that matches the entire "doggie smell" string from beginning 
to end.

#### Example 3: `^doggie smell$`

Matches:
```
doggie smell
```

Does not match:
```
big doggie smell
doggie has an interesting smell
doggie smells
``` 


## The [] bracket expression

You use square brackets in regular expressions to match and include characters. 
You can do so by listing out specific characters or using an alphanumeric range. 
You can also use the square brackets in conjunction with a hat operator to 
exclude characters.

Take the following patterns that include characters in the strings below:

#### Example 1: `[aei]n`

Matches:
```
ban
hen
```

Does not match:
```
undo
on
``` 

#### Example 2: `robot [0-9]`

Matches:
```
robot 7
brobot 180
```

Does not match:
```
robots 7
robot seven
``` 

#### Example 3: `\.[dw]`

Matches:
```
.whale
.dog
```

Does not match:
```
.cat
whale
``` 


### The - inside brackets

You use the dash character to create [character ranges] within square brackets. 
Multiple ranges can be set in the same square brackets. For example, the 
expression `[A-Za-z0-9_]` is often used to match all alphanumeric characters 
in the English language.

Take the following expressions and strings below:

#### Example 1: `[0-5] cats`

Matches:
```
3 cats
33 cats
```

Does not match:
```
336 cats
3cats
``` 

#### Example 2: `[A-D][l-p][o-s]`

Matches:
```
Apple
Dose
```

Does not match:
```
apple
bone
``` 

#### Example 3: `[a-z][0-9][A-Z]`

Matches:
```
h4T
bl7XYZ
```

Does not match:
```
h44T
XYZ7bl
``` 


### The ^ inside brackets

When using `^` inside of square brackets, you are denoting that you want to 
[exclude characters]. In order to exclude characters, you need to wrap the 
operator and the characters you want to exclude within square brackets.

#### Example 1: `[^b]`

Matches:
```
hog
dog
```

Does not match:
```
bog
blog
``` 

#### Example 2: `[^bc]at`

Matches:
```
chat
rat
```

Does not match:
```
hat
cat
``` 

#### Example 3: `[^bc]o[^g]`

Matches:
```
hot
pot
```

Does not match:
```
cog
blog
```

# HTTP Full-Stack Project

In this project, you are going to use Node.js to build a data-driven Web site.
This project already includes the Sequelize models and migrations for you. You
will create a Node.js HTTP server and use it to handle incoming requests from a
browser. Then, you will generate HTML to respond to the request.

Today's project does not address the aesthetics of the visual appearance of the
Web pages. You will have an opportunity later this week to do that. Today is
about _functionality_.

## Project overview

You will build a simple inventory tracking system for managing the amount of
stuff that you have. The Sequelize data model is already created for you because
you now know how to do that pretty well. You'll get to flex those muscles later
this week, too.

You will build the server that accepts incoming HTTP requests using _only_
functionality built into Node.js. You will process the incoming request,
determine what needs to be done, and generate HTML to send back to the client.

This project shows you the underpinnings of how Node.js-based Web applications
work. Then, when you use a framework like Express.js or Koa.js, you will know
what they're doing.

![final app]

### The data model

To focus on the server portion of this, the data model is very simple. It
consists of one entity, the Item. The Item has the following properties.

| Property name | Data type | Constraints         |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| name          | string    | not null, unique    |
| description   | text      | not null            |
| imageName     | string    |                     |
| amount        | integer   | not null, default 0 |

### The functionality

You will create two HTML pages, one static and one dynamic. The static HTML page
will consist of a form that allows you to add new items that you want to track.
The dynamic HTML page will list the each item and its details and give you a
way to reduce the amount on hand.

## Get started

* Clone the starter repository from
  https://github.com/appacademy-starters/node-web-app-starter. But, this time,
  use an extended version of the Git `clone` command to put it in a specific
  directory. You will use the same starter project in the next project, too.

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/appacademy-starters/node-web-app-starter native-node-app
  ```

  Instead of creating a directory named after the repository,
  "node-web-app-starter", this wil create a directory named "native-node-app"
  and put the cloned repository into there.
* Change the working directory into "native-node-app"
* Install the npm dependencies
* Create a database user named "native_node_app" with the password
  "oMbE4FNk3db2LwFT" and the CREATEDB privilege which will look like

  ```sql
  CREATE USER ... WITH CREATEDB PASSWORD ...
  ```

  You add the CREATEDB in there so you can do the next step and not be bothered
  with creating the database yourself
* Run the Sequelize CLI with the `db:create` command to create the database
* Run the Sequelize CLI to migrate the database
* Run the Sequelize CLI to seed the database

## Phase 1: Installing one tool

You will use a development tool to restart the server each time you make a
change to a JavaScript file. This prevents you from having to hit CTRL+C each
time you want to stop and start your server.

The tool is named [nodemon] and is the standard for this type of server
restarting. It is a _development_ tool, so you will install it as a special kind
of dependency, a _development dependency_. You can do that with

```shell
npm install nodemon --save-dev
```

When you deploy your application to production, npm will ignore the development
dependencies because they're not needed when you run your application for other
people to use. Hopefully by that point, your Web application _doesn't restart_!

## Phase 2: Getting the server started

Open the **package.json** file. It specifies that the "main" file for this
project is **server/index.js**. Create a **server** directory and an
**index.js** file in there.

Now, in **package.json**, find the "scripts" section. Add a new entry in there
named "dev" with the value "nodemon server/index.js". It should look like this.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon server/index.js",
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
},
```

That sets up a way to conveniently run the "nodemon" command by typing the
command `npm run dev`. You can run that right now. Because you have an empty
**server/index.js** file, it should report something like this:

```
[nodemon] starting `node server/index.js server/index.js`
[nodemon] clean exit - waiting for changes before restart
```

So, it's just waiting for you to add some code!

To get an HTTP server up and running, you will add code to do the following in
the **server/index.js** file.

* Import the built-in "http" module
* Create a server using the "http" module that returns "I have items" to every
  request
* Tell that server to start listening on port 8081
* Print a message when the server is ready to accept incoming messages

Please look at the sample on the [About Node.js®] page. It has all of the code
that you need to get the above done. You'll want to change the port number from
what it uses to 8081. You'll also want to change the text it sends to the
browser from what it reads to "I have items".

See if you can figure that out on your own. You'll know you're done when you
open up your browser to http://localhost:8081/ (or refresh it because it's
already there) and see the following.

![I have items]

## Phase 3: Understand the code

Hopefully, your code looks similar to the following code.

```js
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 8081;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('I have items');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

Just a reminder: the first three variable declarations and the last call to
`listen` are boilerplate code. Every time you write a Node.js server, you would
write the same code over and over. The real meat of the application is in the
callback function that you pass to `createServer`.

```js
(req, res) => {
  // The code here is what matters. This is the stuff
  // that handles requests from the browser and sends
  // content back to it.
}
```

The first parameter is the "request" object and is of type
`http.IncomingMessage` ([link][link to IncomingMessage]). The second parameter is
the "response" object and is of type `http.ServerResponse` ([link][link to
ServerResponse]).

In the code that you wrote, you set the status code of the response to 200 which
means "OK", if you recall. Then, you set the content type of the content of the
response to "text/plain" which means the browser should just show the content
as plain text. Finally, you use the `end` method to send some content _and_ end
the response.

That last part is _very_ important. If you don't end the response, the browser
will just hang, waiting, expecting more from your server.

In this project, you will use more methods and properties of the
`IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` objects to get your application working.

## Phase 4: Showing images

In the **assets/images** directory of this project are four images that your
server should be able to show. (And more, if you add more.)

A normal thing to do is to translate a URL to a path relative to your
application's root directory. For example, say you typed the following URL into
your browser.

```
http://localhost:8081/images/thread.jpeg
```

It would make sense to have the server send back the content of
**assets/images/thread.jpeg** so the browser can show it. That's what you will
do in this step, but for any of the images.

You'll need a way to read the contents of each file. The modern way to do this
is to use the Promises-based portion of the file system library. At the top of
your **index.js**, import the `readFile` function from the "promises" property
of "fs" library.

```js
const { readFile } = require('fs').promises;
```

You will use the `await` keyword with that function, so you need to change the
signature of the callback method that you pass to the `createServer` method.
Note the addition of the `async` keyword before the parameter list.

```js
const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
```

Again, you will map requests for images to the corresponding file in the
**images** directory. It looks like this.

```
http://localhost:8081/images/filename.ext
                     \__________________/
                              |
                 +------------+
          _______|_________
         /                 \
./assets/images/filename.ext
```

If the image exists, you'll send the contents of the image to the browser. If it
does not, then you will tell the browser that it does not exist by sending a 404
NOT FOUND status code.

### Phase 4a: The happy path

To determine if the path is one that you want, at the top of your `async`
callback, put an if statement that tests if the `req.url` property (which is a
string) starts with "/images/". Replace the comment below to do that.

```js
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (/* req.url start with "/images" */) {

  }


  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('I have items');
});
```

If the test passes, that means that `req.url` will contain a string like
"/images/thread.jpeg". That means that you will want to load the file from
"./assets/images/thread.jpeg" which is the concatenation of the string
"./assets" and the value of `req.url`. This code goes inside the `if` block.

```js
const imageFilePath = './assets' + req.url;
const imageFileContents = await readFile(imageFilePath);
```

Notice that you **did not** specify 'utf-8' as part of the `readFile` call.
That's because the content of an image file is **not** UTF-8 encoded text.
Instead, it's binary. This way without the encoding just returns the raw data
that is then sent to the browser.

After that, you need to should set the status code of the response to 200 to
indicate everything is OK. Then, you need to set the content type which takes a
little bit of figuring, so you can delay that for just a moment. Assume that the
browser has requested an image in the JPEG format. Finally, you end the response
by sending the data of the file that you read.

Add this code inside the `if` block after reading the file's contents.

```js
res.statusCode = 200;
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'image/jpeg');
res.end(imageFileContents);
return;
```

The `return` at the end prevents any other code after it to run, that code at
the bottom that sends back plain text.

You should now be able to see any of the following in your browser!

* http://localhost:8081/images/thread.jpeg
* http://localhost:8081/images/horseshoe.jpeg
* http://localhost:8081/images/lint.jpeg

Most likely, you can also see the following image, too.

* http://localhost:8081/images/gravel.png

That's because browsers are really for giving. Even though you tell the browser
that you are sending JPEG data with the content type "image/jpeg", the browser
inspects the data and figures out it's an image in the PNG format. But, you
should not rely on the forgiveness of the browser. Instead, you should determine
the type of image format the file contains from the file extension, either
".jpeg" or ".png". Then, you send back "image/jpeg" or "image/png" based on the
file extension.

You can use the built-in "path" library to determine the file extension. Then,
you can use that information to send back the correct image format type in the
`setHeader` method.

At the top of the **index.js** file, import the "path" library.

```js
const path = require('path');
```

Here's a link to the "path" library: https://nodejs.org/api/path.html. Find the
method that will extract the file extension from a path. Then, use that in
your code to send back the correct image type.

```js
const fileExtension = /* Use the path library to get the file extension */;
const imageType = 'image/' + fileExtension.substring(1);
res.statusCode = 200;
res.setHeader('Content-Type', imageType); // Use the image type
```

![Proper image type]

Make sure you still see "I have items" when you go to http://localhost:8081.

## Phase 4b: No image found

Try accessing this URL: images/unknown.png. You will see
an error message in your console about an unhandled promise rejection not being
able to open './assets/images/unknown.png'. Worse yet, the browser is just
hanging. That's because this line of code:

```js
const imageFileContents = await readFile(imageFilePath);
```

threw an error, it wasn't handled, and the `end` method never gets called on the
response object. That means the browser just waits and waits and waits.

If you get a request for an image that does not exist, you can just catch this
error and send back a 404 and no content. Replace that single line of code
above with this block of code.

Wrap that line of code above in a `try`/`catch` block. In the `catch` block,
set the status code of the response to 404. Then, just call the `end` method
of the response with no parameters. The last statement of the `catch` block
should be a `return;` statement to prevent other code from running after you
handle this error.

You'll have to fix the declaration of the `imageFileContents` variable so that
it works.

Refresh the browser. You should now get a 404 page when you try to access an
image that does not exist. You should see the images that do exist when you go
to their corresponding URLs.

Make sure you still see "I have items" when you go to http://localhost:8081.

## Phase 5: Showing a static HTML page

Here's some HTML that shows a form that you will use to add new items to the
database. You will serve this statically. That means you won't change any of
its contents. Instead, you'll just read the file from disk and send it to the
browser.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Add an item</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <a href="/">Back to the main page</a>
  </header>
  <main>
    <form method="post" action="/items">
      <div>
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="description">Description</label>
        <textarea name="description" id="description" required></textarea>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="amount">Starting amount</label>
        <input type="number" name="amount" id="amount" required>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button type="submit">Create a new item</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </main>
</body>
</html>

```

You'll learn a lot more about forms, this week. There are three things to note
about this form.

* The "method" attribute of the `form` element is "post" which means the value
  of `req.method` in our request handler will be "POST". (It is always
  uppercase when read from the `req.method` property.)
* The "action" attribute of the `form` element is "/items". That will be the
  value of `req.url` that you will need to check when you want to handle the
  form submission.
* The "name" attribute of the `input` and `textarea` (and all form elements) are
  the keys that we will use to get the values that a person supplies by typing
  into the form.

Create a **views** directory in the root of your project. Save the HTML into a
file there named **add-item.html**.

![add-item.html in views directory]

To serve this HTML, create a new `if` block that checks to see if the value of
the `req.url` property is equal to "/items/new". If it is, then do what you did
with the images. The path to the HTML file should be "./views/add-item.html".
Read the file's contents. Set the status code to 200. Set the content type to
"text/html". Send the content of the file to the browser and end the response.
Use a `return;` statement to make sure no other code runs.

When you get that working, you should be able to navigate to
http://localhost:8081/items/new and see this.

![seeing form in the browser]

## Phase 6: First step in dynamic content

Navigate your browser back to http://localhost:8081 where you see "I have
items". (If that's not working, figure out how it broke and fix it.) Now, you
will query the database for the number of items in it and report it. Instead of
seeing "I have items", it should report something like "I have 4 items".

This is primarily Sequelize code. At the top of **index.js**, import the Item
model.

```js
const { Item } = require('../models');
```

Down at the bottom of your callback after your `if` blocks and before the line
that reads `res.statusCode = 200;`, use the `findAll` method of the Item model
to get all of the items in the database. That should return an array of the
objects. Use the length of that array to show the current number of items in the
database by changing `res.end('I have items');` to include the number of items.

![seeing number of items in the browser]

It may surprise you to learn that this is really what most Web applications do.
Read some data from a database. Use that data to generate some content. Send
the content to the browser. That's the simple recipe.

Do something real quick before the next phase. Instead of serving plain text,
here, change that content type to serve HTML. Then, in whatever string you're
passing to the `res.end` method, add this HTML snippet at the beginning of it so
you can easily get to the "add a new item" form.

```html
<div><a href="/items/new">Add a new item</a></div>
```

![seeing number of items with a link]

Test the link by clicking on it. It should take you to the form.

## Phase 7: Handling the adding of an item

Now's the time to handle the adding of an item from that form! Click the link
to get to the add the form or navigate to http://localhost:8081/items/new in
your browser. If you fill out the form and click the button, it just takes you
back to the main page and doesn't do anything. It's time to change that.

Add a new `if` block that checks that _both_ of these conditions are true:

* The value of `req.url` is equal to "/items"
* The value of `req.method` is equal to "POST"

Inside that `if` block is where you will handle the data that someone sends to
the server through the form. You'll use it to create a new Item and save it to
the database. Then, you'll redirect back to the main page.

### Phase 7a: Getting the submitted data

Open up your developer tools. On the Network tab, click the "Preserve log"
checkbox above the timeline. Then, fill out the form and click the "Create a new
item" button. That will make the request. Select the "items" entry in the list
of network requests below the timeline. You should see a section entitled
**Form Data**. Click the "view source" link.

![seeing the submitted data]

What you see is likely like this, but with whatever values you put in the
fields.

```
name=Shoe&description=I+have+one+shoe+that+I+cant+seem+to+find+its+pair.+So%2C+I+guess+I+have+one+of+those.&amount=1
```

That's the content that is sent with the HTTP request to your server. The full
HTTP request looks something like

```
POST /items HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8081
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 116
... more headers ...

name=Shoe&description=I+have+one+shoe+that+I+cant+seem+to+find+its+pair.+So%2C+I+guess+I+have+one+of+those.&amount=1
```

That's the "URL encoded" format that you read about in the Five Parts Of A URL
reading. You'll parse that in the next step. What you have to do, now, is get it
from the `IncomingMessage` object. That object is a readable stream, so you will
read the bytes from the stream and turn them into a string to use in the next
step.

When your callback is invoked by the server object, it has _only_ read the
headers portion of the HTTP request. The body of the HTTP request (if there is
one) could still be traveling over the airwaves and wires from your computer to
the server. This way, your Web application can look at the values in the headers
and determine whether or not it wants to even respond. Maybe the content length
is 400Gb. You don't want your server spending however long it takes to read all
of that data, so you can just end it.

To do this easily, you will use a variety of the `for` loop that works with
asynchronous iterable values as well as normal one. It is the [for await...of]
loop. Like the `for of` loop, it loops over values rather than indexes. But, the
value after the `of` can return Promises which the for loop will wait on for
them to resolve before invoking the block of code.

That's a lot of words. Here's what it looks like. Put this in your `if` block
that handles "POST /items".

```js
let body = '';
for await (let chunk of req) {
  body += chunk;
}
// body now contains all of the data
// from the request
```

This works because `req` is an `IncomingMessage` message object which inherits
from `ReadableStream` which implements the [asynchronous iterator][asynchronous
iterator for ReadableStream] property.

### Phase 7b: Parsing the submitted data

Now that you have all of the data in the `body` variable, it's time to split it
up into the data that you want. From the form, it will look like this as a raw
string:

```
name=value1&description=value2&amount=value3
```

Use string manipulation to break that into its separate pieces so that you can
access each of key value pairs.

* Split the string on ampersands, first.
* Split each value from the previous step on equal signs.

To handle the encoded values on the right side of the equal sign, it is a
two-step process:

* Replace each of the "+" characters with a space. You have to use a global
  regular expression to do this with the `replace` method because JavaScript
  will only replace the first occurrence in the string without a global
  regular expression. If the value is in a variable named `s`, you would call
  `s.replace(/\+/g, ' ')` to replace all of the "+' characters in a string with
  spaces.
* After replacing the plusses, take the value and pass it to the
  `decodeURIComponent` function which will go about translating the percent-sign
  encoded values into single characters.

### Phase 7c: Create an Item

You should have the data broken into pieces that you can now access. Use your
Item model to build and save (or create) a new item.

### Phase 7d: Redirect the browser

Redirecting the browser to go to another URL is a two-step process, too. You
send back status code 302. You also set the header "Location" to the URL that
you want it to navigate to. For this project, set the "Location" to "/". Then
end the response.

![show form completion]

Make sure that you use a `return` statement or something to prevent the default
code at the bottom of your request handler from running.

## Phase 8: Generate dynamic content

At the bottom of your handler, you've already queried the items in your Item
objects from the database. Now, it is time to show the items rather than just
displaying how many are in the database.

You can use the `write` method of the `ServerResponse` object in the `res` to
write your HTML to the browser as you're generating it. Your code may look
something like this.

```js
const items = await Item.findAll();
res.statusCode = 200;
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
res.end(`
  <div><a href="/items/new">Add a new item</a></div>
  I have ${items.length} items
`);
```

Take a look at this code which just expands on the previous block. It writes the
proper beginning of an HTML document, then writes the dynamic content, then ends
it with the proper end of an HTML document.

```js
const items = await Item.findAll();
res.statusCode = 200;
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
res.write(`
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Inventory</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <div><a href="/items/new">Add a new item</a></div>
    </header>
    <main>`);

res.write(`I have ${items.length} items`);

res.end(`
    </main>
  </body>
  </html>`);
```

In the place where there's only the one line of dynamic content, change it to
have something else, something that shows the name of the item, the amount of
them you have, and the associated image, if `imageName` is not `null` or
`undefined`.

The following screenshot shows where an open `table` tag has been added to the
end of the string for the first write, a close `table` tag has been added to the
beginning of the string of the `res.end` call, and looping is used to create a
new table row (`tr`) with table data (`td`) for each of the properties of the
Item.

![table of items]

It looks, in part, like this.

```js
for (let item of items) {
  res.write(`
    <tr></td>
  `);

  // Only write an IMG tag if there is a value
  // in imageName

  res.write(`
    </td>

    <!-- Write more TDs here with the details of the item -->

    <td>`);
  if (item.amount > 0) {
    res.write(`
      <form method="post" action="/items/${item.id}/used">
        <button type="submit">Use one</button>
      </form>
    `);
  }
  res.write(`</td>
  </tr>`);
}
```

As seen above, for each item, you should also create a form that has the
following content for items with an amount greater than 0.

```html
<form method="post" action="/items/«item id»/used">
  <button type="submit">Use one</button>
</form>
```

That's the last handler that you'll write to complete the project!

## Phase 9

When there is a POST request to the path "/items/«item id»/used", you want to
reduce the amount by 1 of the item specified by the «item id» in the path. Write
another `if` block that handles that HTTP request. Parse the id from the path.
Use that id to get the Item from the database. Reduce the amount by 1. Save the
Item back to the database. Redirect back to "/".

![final app]

## Complete!

That was quite a ride! You created a full-stack Web application! You pulled data
from a database to generate HTML. You sent the HTML to the browser. You handled
requests, both GET and POST, from the browser to interact with and modify the
data in the database. This is literally what Web developers do every single day.

Except with better tools. Tools like you learn about tomorrow.
