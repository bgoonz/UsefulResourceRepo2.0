/**
 * In this file, you will implement the friendsOf function that will calculate
 * the group of friends that a person has a certain distance from them.
 *
 * @param {Object} adjacencyList - The adjacency list that describes the graph,
 * never null or undefined
 * @param {string} name - The name of the person from where you will start your
 * search, never null or undefined
 * @param {number} distance - The distance away that you will traverse to find
 * the person's friends-of list, always a value greater than or equal to 1
 *
 * You will also need to implement a friendsOfRecursion function that will
 * recurse through your friends graph. friendsOf will call this.
 *
 * @param {string} name - the name of the person from where you will start
 * your search, never null or undefined.
 * @param {Object} adjacencyList - The adjacency list that describes the graph,
 * never null or undefined
 * @param {Set} visited - A list of all the graph nodes we have visited
 * @param {number} maxDistance - the maximum distance you want to recurse into
 * the graph, for example 1 should find immediate friends and 3 should find
 * immediate friends, friends of immediate friends, and friends of those friends
 * @param {number} currentDistance - the current distance we are at during our
 * recursion
 *
 * Hint: You can convert a Set into an Array using the `Array.from()` method.
