## Problem 4: Max Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: the depth at the root is 0.

```js
  //   3
  //  / \
  // 9  20
  //   /  \
  //  15   7
```
