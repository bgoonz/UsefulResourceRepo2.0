    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this section, you’ll have a chance to practice the concepts you’ve
      learned in the videos. First, review the core concepts covered that you’ll
      need to keep in mind. Then go through the exercises below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, these are for your own benefit. Feel free to skip them if you
      don’t find a particular exercise valuable or you get stuck for too long.
    </p>
    <h2 id="core-concepts">Core concepts</h2>
    <h3 id="determining-the-full-path-to-a-file">
      Determining the full path to a file
    </h3>
    <p>
      Remember that the file location when loading files like
      <code>the_file.txt</code> depend on the working directory, which your
      program probably doesn’t control. So we need to use the
      <code>os</code> module to work from known locations.
    </p>
    <pre><code>directory = os.path.dirname(__file__)
filename = os.path.join(directory, &#39;the_file.txt&#39;)
# Now filename is a full path</code></pre>
    <h3 id="opening-a-file-for-reading">Opening a file for reading</h3>
    <p>
      To open a file we use, well, the <code>open()</code> function. But as we
      saw, we should do this within a <code>with</code> block to ensure it’s
      closed and flushed in a timely manner. Note the <strong>r</strong> passed
      to open for read.
    </p>
    <pre><code>with open(filename, &#39;r&#39;, encoding=&#39;utf-8&#39;) as fin:
    # work with fin here

# fin is closed and useless at this point.</code></pre>
    <h3 id="writing-to-a-file">Writing to a file</h3>
    <p>
      Writing to a file is similar to reading, it’s just about how you open it.
      Note the <strong>w</strong> for write and <strong>fout</strong> to tell us
      that it’s an output not input file stream.
    </p>
    <pre><code>with open(filename, &#39;w&#39;, encoding=&#39;utf-8&#39;) as fout:
    # work with four here</code></pre>
    <h3 id="using-json-module-with-file-streams">
      Using json module with file streams
    </h3>
    <p>
      Given a file stream, json can read or write objects to/from the json file
      format.
    </p>
    <pre><code>import json

# load the rolls from fin input stream
rolls = json.load(fin)

# save the leader dictionary to the fout file stream
json.dump(leaders, fout)</code></pre>
    <h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
    <p>
      Now it’s your turn. In this practice, go back to the tic tac toe game we
      created back in the chapter on problem solving. Alternatively, if you made
      it through Connect 4, you can work with that one instead. Your job will be
      to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a leader board (feel free to use JSON like we did).</li>
      <li>
        Add a running log file (test with <code>tail -n 20 -f FILENAME</code> on
        macOS and Linux, just open in PyCharm on Windows and it’ll change).
      </li>
      <li>
        For extra credit, you can try to use
        <a href="https://logbook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">LogBook</a> to
        improve the logging (but it will require a few concepts we haven’t
        covered yet).
