# Binary Tree

Trees are commonly represented as **binary trees**, a _rooted_ tree structure in which each node has no more than two children.

## Constraints

- A child has only _one_ parent and the root node has _no_ parent.
- Each node can have a max of 2 children.

A **node** of a binary tree is represented by a structure containing **data** and two pointers (**left** and **right**) to other structures of the same type.

#### An example of a node written in JavaScript:

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value = null) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}
```
