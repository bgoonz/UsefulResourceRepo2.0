## General Tree

</p>

A **general tree**, or _k_-ary tree, is made up of **nodes** (or **vertices**) connected by **edges**.

A tree has a **root** node and potentially many **levels** of an arbitrary number of **children** that form a hierarchy.

If a node is connected to other nodes below it, that node is called the **parent** node, and the nodes following it are called **child** nodes. Each node in the tree can be see as a **subtree**.

## Constraints

- A child has only _one_ parent and the root node has _no_ parent.

_Note: A tree is a graph without cycles._

## Common Operations

#### Insert

<img width="20px" />Inserts a node in the tree.

#### Search

<img width="20px" />This searches for a node with the given value in the tree and returns `true` if it exists, otherwise `false`.

#### Min/Max

<img width="20px" />Returns the minimum or maximum value in the tree.

#### Remove

<img width="20px" />Removes a node from the tree.

## Terminology

#### Root

<img width="20px" />The top node in a tree.

#### Child

<img width="20px" />A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.

#### Parent

<img width="20px" />A node with other nodes connected below it.

#### Siblings

<img width="20px" />A group of nodes with the same parent.

#### Leaf

<img width="20px" />A node with no children.

#### Branch node

<img width="20px" />A node with at last one child.

#### Degree

<img width="20px" />For a given node, its number of children. A leaf is necessarily degree zero.

#### Edge

<img width="20px" />The connection between one node and another.

#### Path

<img width="20px" />A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.

#### Level

<img width="20px" />The level of a node is defined as: 1 + the number of edges between the node and the root.

#### Depth

<img width="20px" />The depth of a node is defined as: the number of edges between the node and the root.

#### Height of node

<img width="20px" />The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path between that node and a leaf.

#### Height of a tree

<img width="20px" />The height of a tree is the height of its root node.

#### Forest

<img width="20px" />A forest is a set of `n ≥ 0` disjoint trees.
