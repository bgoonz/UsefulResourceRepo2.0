# Data Structures II

Topics:

- Tree
- Graph
- Binary Search Tree

#### Trees

- Should have the methods: `addChild`, and `contains`
- Each node on the tree should have a `value` property and a `children` array.
- `addChild(value)` should accept a value and add it to that node's `children` array.
- `contains(value)` should return `true` if the tree or its children the given value.
- When you add nodes to the `children` array use `new Tree(value)` to create the node.
- You can instantiate the `Tree` class inside of itself.

#### Binary Search Tree

- Should have the methods: `insert`, `contains`, `depthFirstForEach`, and `breadthFirstForEach`.
- `insert(value)` inserts the new value at the correct location in the tree.
- `contains(value)` searches the tree and returns `true` if the the tree contains the specified value.
- `depthFirstForEach(cb)` should iterate over the tree using DFS and passes each node of the tree to the given callback function.
- `breadthFirstForEach(cb)` should iterate over the tree using BFS and passes each node of the tree to the given callback function (hint: you'll need to either re-implement or import a queue data structure for this).

#### Graphs

- Should have methods named `addNode`, `contains`, `removeNode`, `addEdge`, `getEdge`, and `removeEdge`
- `addNode(newNode, toNode)` should add a new item to the graph. If `toNode` is given then the new node should share an edge with an existing node `toNode`.
- `contains(value)` should return true if the graph contains the given value.
- `removeNode(value)` should remove the specified value from the graph.
- `addEdge(fromNode, toNode)` should add an edge between the two specified nodes.
- `getEdge(fromNode, toNode)` should return `true` if an edge exists between the two specified graph nodes.
- `removeEdge(fromNode, toNode)` should remove the edge between the two specified nodes.

### Extra Credit

- Add a method to the `Graph` class that searches through the graph using edges. Make this search first as a depth first search and then refactor to a breadth first search.
- Read up on [heaps](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)>) here. Then implement one!
- Read up on [red-black trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) here. Then implement one!
