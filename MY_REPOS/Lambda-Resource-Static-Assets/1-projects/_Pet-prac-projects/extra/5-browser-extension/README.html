    <p>
      Building browser extensions is a fun and interesting way to think about
      the performance of your apps while building a different type of web asset.
      This module includes lessons on how browsers work and how to deploy a
      browser extension, how to build a form, call an API, and use local
      storage, and how to gauge the performance of your website and improve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll build a browser extension that works on Edge, Chrome, and Firefox.
      This extension, which is like a mini web site that is tailored to a very
      specific task, checks the
      <a href="https://www.co2signal.com">C02 Signal API</a> for a given
      region’s electricity usage and carbon intensity, and returns a reading on
      the region’s carbon footprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      This extension can be called ad hoc by a user once an API key and region
      code is input into a form to determine local electricity usage and thereby
      offer data that can influence a user’s electricity decisions. For example,
      it may be preferable to delay running a clothes dryer (a carbon-intense
      activity) during a period of high electricity usage in your region.

      The idea for this web carbon trigger was offered by Asim Hussain, lead at
      Microsoft of the Green Cloud Advocacy team and author of the
      <a href="https://principles.green/">Green Principles</a>. It was
      originally a
      <a href="https://github.com/jlooper/green">web site project</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure of the browser extension was influenced by
      <a href="https://github.com/onedebos/covtension"
        >Adebola Adeniran’s COVID extension</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept behind the ‘dot’ icon system was suggested by the icon
      structure of the
      <a href="https://energylollipop.com/">Energy Lollipop</a> browser
      extension for California emissions.
