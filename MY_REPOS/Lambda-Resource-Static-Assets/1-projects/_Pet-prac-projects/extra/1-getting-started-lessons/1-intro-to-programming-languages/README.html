    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we’ll cover:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is programming?</li>
      <li>Types of programming languages</li>
      <li>Basic elements of a program</li>
      <li>Useful software and tooling for the professional developer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-programming">What is Programming?</h2>
    <p>
      Programming (also known as coding) is the process of writing instructions
      to a device, such as a computer or mobile device. We write these
      instructions with a programming language, which is then interpreted by the
      device. These sets of instructions may be referred to by various names,
      but <em>program</em>, <em>computer program</em>,
      <em>application (app)</em>, and <em>executable</em> are a few popular
      names.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>program</em> can be anything that is written with code; websites,
      games, and phone apps are programs. While it’s possible to create a
      program without writing code, the underlying logic is interpreted to the
      device and that logic was most likely written with code. A program that is
      <em>running</em> or <em>executing code</em> is carrying out instructions.
      The device that you’re currently reading this lesson with is running a
      program to print it to your screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✅ Do a little research: who is considered to have been the world’s first
      computer programmer?
    </p>
    <h2 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h2>
    <p>
      Programming languages serve a main purpose: for developers to build
      instructions to send to a device. Devices only can understand binary (1s
      and 0s), and for <em>most</em> developers that’s not a very efficient way
      to communicate. Programming languages are a vehicle for communication
      between humans and computers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programming languages come in different formats and may serve different
      purposes. For example, JavaScript is primarily used for web applications,
      while Bash is primarily used for operating systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Low level languages</em> typically require fewer steps than
      <em>high level languages</em> for a device to interpret instructions.
      However, what makes high level languages popular is its readability and
      support. JavaScript is considered a high level language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following code illustrates the difference between a high level
      language with JavaScript and low level language with ARM assembly code.

    <p>
      Believe it or not, <em>they’re both doing the same thing</em>: printing a
      Fibonacci sequence up to 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✅ A Fibonacci sequence is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">defined</a> as a
      set of numbers such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones,
      starting from 0 and 1.
    </p>
    <h2 id="elements-of-a-program">Elements of a program</h2>
    <p>
      A single instruction in a program is called a <em>statement</em> and will
      usually have a character or line spacing that marks where the instruction
      ends, or <em>terminates</em>. How a program terminates varies with each
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most programs rely on using data from a user or elsewhere, where
      statements may rely on data to carry out instructions. Data can change how
      a program behaves, so programming languages come with a way to temporarily
      store data that can be used later. This data is called <em>variables</em>.
      Variables are statements that instruct a device to save data in its
      memory. Variables in programs are similar to ones in algebra, where they
      have a unique name and their value may change over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s a chance that some statements will not be executed by a device.
      This is usually by design when written by the developer or by accident
      when an unexpected error occurs. This type of control of an application
      makes it more robust and maintainable. Typically these changes in control
      happen when certain decisions are met. A common statement in modern
      programming languages to control how a program is run is the
      <code>if..else</code> statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✅ You’ll learn more about this type of statement in subsequent lessons
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, you’ll learn about some software that you might find very
      useful as you start your professional development journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>development environment</strong> is a unique set of tools and
      features that a developer will use often when writing software. Some of
      these tools have been customized for a developer specific needs, and may
      change over time if a developer changes priorities in work or personal
      projects, or when they use a different programming language. Development
      environments are as unique as the developers who use them.
    </p>
    <h3 id="editors">Editors</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most crucial tools for software development is the editor.
      Editors are where you write your code and sometimes where you will run
      your code.
    </p>
    <p>Developers rely on editors for a few additional reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Debugging</em> Discovering bugs and errors by stepping through code,
        line by line. Some editors have debugging capabilities, or can be
        customized and added for specific programming languages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Syntax highlighting</em> Adds colors and text formatting to code,
        makes it easier to read. Most editors allow customized syntax
        highlighting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Extensions and Integrations</em> Additions that are specialized for
        developers, by developers, for access to additional tools that aren’t
        built into the base editor. For example, many developers also need a way
        to document their code and explain how it works and will install a spell
        check extension to check for typos. Most of these additions are intended
        for use within a specific editor, and most editors come with a way to
        search for available extensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Customization</em> Most editors are extremely customizable, and each
        developer will have their own unique development environment that suits
        their needs. Many also allow developers to create their own extension.
      </li>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="browsers">Browsers</h3>
    <p>
      Another crucial tool is the browser. Web developers rely on the browser to
      observe how their code runs on the web, it’s also used to view visual
      elements of a web page that are written in the editor, like HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many browsers come with <em>developer tools</em> (DevTools) that contain a
      set of helpful features and information to assist developers to collect
      and capture important insights about their application. For example: If a
      web page has errors, it’s sometimes helpful to know when they occurred.
      DevTools in a browser can be configured to capture this information.

      Some developers prefer a less graphical view for their daily tasks and
      rely on the command line to achieve this. Developing code requires a
      significant amount of typing, and some developers prefer to not disrupt
      their flow on the keyboard and will use keyboard shortcuts to swap between
      desktop windows, work on different files, and use tools. Most tasks can be
      completed with a mouse, but one benefit of using the command line is that
      a lot can be done with command line tools without the need of swapping
      between the mouse and keyboard. Another benefit of the command line is
      that they’re configurable and you can save your custom configuration,
      change it later, and also import it to new development machines. Because
      development environments are so unique to each developer, some will avoid
      using the command line, some will rely on it entirely, and some prefer a
      mix of the two.

      When a developer wants to learn something new, they’ll most likely turn to
      documentation to learn how to use it. Developers rely on documentation
      often to guide them through how to use tools and languages properly, and
      also to gain deeper knowledge of how it works.
