        Web
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This quote perfectly highlights the importance of creating accessible
      websites. An application that can’t be accessed by all is by definition
      exclusionary. As web developers we should always have accessibility in
      mind. By having this focus from the beginning you will be well on your way
      to ensure everyone can access the pages you create. In this lesson, you’ll
      learn about the tools that can help you ensure that your web assets are
      accessible and how to build with accessibility in mind.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tools-to-use">Tools to use</h2>
    <h3 id="screen-readers">Screen readers</h3>
    <p>One of the best-known accessibility tools are screen readers.</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">Screen readers</a>
      are commonly used clients for those with vision impairments. As we spend
      time ensuring a browser properly conveys the information we wish to share,
      we must also ensure a screen reader does the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its most basic, a screen reader will read a page from top to bottom
      audibly. If your page is all text, the reader will convey the information
      in a similar fashion to a browser. Of course, web pages are rarely purely
      text; they will contain links, graphics, color, and other visual
      components. Care must be taken to ensure that this information is read
      correctly by a screen reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every web developer should familiarize themselves with a screen reader. As
      highlighted above, it’s the client your users will utilize. Much in the
      same way you’re familiar with how a browser operates, you should learn how
      a screen reader operates. Fortunately, screen readers are built into most
      operating systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some browsers also have built-in tools and extensions that can read text
      aloud or even provide some basic navigational features, such as
      <a
        href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4000734/microsoft-edge-accessibility-features"
        >these accessibility-focused Edge browser tools</a
      >. These are also important accessibility tools, but function very
      differently from screen readers and they should not be mistaken for screen
      reader testing tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✅ Try a screen reader and browser text reader. On Windows
      <a
        href="https://support.microsoft.com/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1"
        >Narrator</a
      >
      is included by default, and
      <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/jaws/">JAWS</a> and
      <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda/">NVDA</a> can also be
      installed. On macOS and iOS,
      <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/welcome/10"
        >VoiceOver</a
      >
      is installed by default.
    </p>
    <h3 id="zoom">Zoom</h3>
    <p>
      Another tool commonly used by people with vision impairments is zooming.
      The most basic type of zooming is static zoom, controlled through
      <code>Control + plus sign (+)</code> or by decreasing screen resolution.
      This type of zoom causes the entire page to resize, so using
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design"
        >responsive design</a
      >
      is important to provide a good user experience at increased zoom levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another type of zoom relies on specialized software to magnify one area of
      the screen and pan, much like using a real magnifying glass. On Windows,
      <a
        href="https://support.microsoft.com/windows/use-magnifier-to-make-things-on-the-screen-easier-to-see-414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198"
        >Magnifier</a
      >
      is built in, and
      <a
        href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/training/zoomtext/getting-started/"
        >ZoomText</a
      >
      is a third-party magnification software with more features and a larger
      user base. Both macOS and iOS have a built-in magnification software
      called <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/">Zoom</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="contrast-checkers">Contrast checkers</h3>
    <p>
      Colors on web sites need to be carefully chosen to answer the needs of
      color-blind users or people who have difficulty seeing low-contrast
      colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✅ Test a web site you enjoy using for color usage with a browser
      extension such as
      <a
        href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/wcag-color-contrast-check/idahaggnlnekelhgplklhfpchbfdmkjp?hl=en-US"
        >WCAG’s color checker</a
      >. What do you learn?
    </p>
    <h3 id="lighthouse">Lighthouse</h3>
    <p>
      In the developer tool area of your browser, you’ll find the Lighthouse
      tool. This tool is important to get a first view of the accessibility (as
      well as other analysis) of a web site. While it’s important not to rely
      exclusively on Lighthouse, a 100% score is very helpful as a baseline.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✅ Find Lighthouse in your browser’s developer tool panel and run an
      analysis on any site. what do you discover?
    </p>
    <h2 id="designing-for-accessibility">Designing for accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      Accessibility is a relatively large topic. To help you out, there are
      numerous resources available.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://accessibility.umn.edu/your-role/web-developers"
          >Accessible U - University of Minnesota</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While we won’t be able to cover every aspect of creating accessible sites,
      below are some of the core tenets you will want to implement. Designing an
      accessible page from the start is <strong>always</strong> easier than
      going back to an existing page to make it accessible.
    </p>
    <h2 id="good-display-principles">Good display principles</h2>
    <h3 id="color-safe-palettes">Color safe palettes</h3>
    <p>
      People see the world in different ways, and this includes colors. When
      selecting a color scheme for your site, you should ensure it’s accessible
      to all. One great
      <a href="http://colorsafe.co/"
        >tool for generating color palettes is Color Safe</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✅ Identify a web site that is very problematic in its use of color. Why?
    </p>
    <h3 id="use-the-correct-html">Use the correct HTML</h3>
    <p>
      With CSS and JavaScript it’s possible to make any element look like any
      type of control. <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> could be used to create a
      <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> could become a
      hyperlink. While this might be considered easier to style, it conveys
      nothing to a screen reader. Use the appropriate HTML when creating
      controls on a page. If you want a hyperlink, use <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.
      Using the right HTML for the right control is called making use of
      Semantic HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✅ Go to any web site and see if the designers and developers are using
      HTML properly. Can you find a button that should be a link? Hint: right
      click and choose ‘View Page Source’ in your browser to look at underlying
      code.
    </p>
    <h3 id="create-a-descriptive-heading-hierarchy">
      Create a descriptive heading hierarchy
    </h3>
    <p>
      Screen reader users
      <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/#finding"
        >rely heavily on headings</a
      >
      to find information and navigate through a page. Writing descriptive
      heading content and using semantic heading tags are important for creating
      an easily navigable site for screen reader users.
    </p>
    <h3 id="use-good-visual-clues">Use good visual clues</h3>
    <p>
      CSS offers complete control over the look of any element on a page. You
      can create text boxes without an outline or hyperlinks without an
      underline. Unfortunately removing those clues can make it more challenging
      for someone who depends on them to be able to recognize the type of
      control.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-importance-of-link-text">The importance of link text</h2>
    <p>
      Hyperlinks are core to navigating the web. As a result, ensuring a screen
      reader can properly read links allows all users to navigate your site.
    </p>
    <h3 id="screen-readers-and-links">Screen readers and links</h3>
    <p>
      As you would expect, screen readers read link text in the same way they’d
      read any other text on the page. With this in mind, the text demonstrated
      below might feel perfectly acceptable.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The little penguin, sometimes known as the fairy penguin, is the
        smallest penguin in the world.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_penguin">Click here</a>
        for more information.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>

      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE</strong> As you’re about to read, you should
        <strong>never</strong> create links which look like the above.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Remember, screen readers are a different interface from browsers with a
      different set of features.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-problem-with-using-the-url">The problem with using the URL</h3>
    <p>
      Screen readers read the text. If a URL appears in the text, the screen
      reader will read the URL. Generally speaking, the URL does not convey
      meaningful information, and can sound annoying. You may have experienced
      this if your phone has ever audibly read a text message with a URL.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-problem-with-click-here">The problem with “click here”</h3>
    <p>
      Screen readers also have the ability to read only the hyperlinks on a
      page, much in the same way a sighted person would scan a page for links.
      If the link text is always “click here”, all the user will hear is “click
      here, click here, click here, click here, click here, …” All links are now
      indistinguishable from one another.
    </p>
    <h3 id="good-link-text">Good link text</h3>
    <p>
      Good link text briefly describes what’s on the other side of the link. In
      the above example talking about little penguins, the link is to the
      Wikipedia page about the species. The phrase
      <em>little penguins</em> would make for perfect link text as it makes it
      clear what someone will learn about if they click the link - little
      penguins.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_penguin">little penguin</a
        >, sometimes known as the fairy penguin, is the smallest penguin in the
        world.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ✅ Surf the web for a few minutes to find pages that use obscure linking
      strategies. Compare them with other, better-linked sites. What do you
      learn?
    </p>
    <h4 id="search-engine-notes">Search engine notes</h4>
    <p>
      As an added bonus for ensuring your site is accessible to all, you’ll help
      search engines navigate your site as well. Search engines use link text to
      learn the topics of pages. So using good link text helps everyone!
    </p>
    <h3 id="aria">ARIA</h3>
    <p>Imagine the following page:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr class="header">
          <th>Product</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Order</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td>Widget</td>
          <td><a href="&#39;#&#39;">Description</a></td>
          <td><a href="&#39;#&#39;">Order</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td>Super widget</td>
          <td><a href="&#39;#&#39;">Description</a></td>
          <td><a href="&#39;#&#39;">Order</a></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      In this example, duplicating the text of description and order make sense
      for someone using a browser. However, someone using a screen reader would
      only hear the words <em>description</em> and <em>order</em> repeated
      without context.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support these types of scenarios, HTML supports a set of attributes
      known as
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA"
        >Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</a
      >. These attributes allow you to provide additional information to screen
      readers.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: Like many aspects of HTML, browser and screen
        reader support may vary. However, most mainline clients support ARIA
        attributes.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You can use <code>aria-label</code> to describe the link when the format
      of the page doesn’t allow you to. The description for widget could be set
      as
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">

      ✅ In general, using Semantic markup as described above supersedes the use
      of ARIA, but sometimes there is no semantic equivalent for various HTML
      widgets. A good example is a Tree. There’s no HTML equivalent for a tree,
      so you identify the generic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for this element with
      a proper role and aria values. The
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA"
        >MDN documentation on ARIA</a
      >
      contains more useful information.

    <h2 id="images">Images</h2>
    <p>
      It goes without saying screen readers are unable to automatically read
      what’s in an image. Ensuring images are accessible doesn’t take much work
      - it’s what the <code>alt</code> attribute is all about. All meaningful
      images should have an <code>alt</code> to describe what they are. Images
      that are purely decorative should have their <code>alt</code> attribute
      set to an empty string: <code>alt=""</code>. This prevents screen readers
      from unnecessarily announcing the decorative image.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✅ As you might expect, search engines are also unable to understand
      what’s in an image. They also use alt text. So once again, ensuring your
      page is accessible provides additional bonuses!

    <h2 id="the-keyboard">The keyboard</h2>
    <p>
      Some users are unable to use a mouse or trackpad, instead relying on
      keyboard interactions to tab from one element to the next. It’s important
      for your web site to present your content in logical order so a keyboard
      user can access each interactive element as they move down a document. If
      you build your web pages with semantic markup and use CSS to style their
      visual layout, your site should be keyboard-navigable, but it’s important
      to test this aspect manually. Learn more about
      <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/"
        >keyboard navigation strategies</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✅ Go to any web site and try to navigate through it using only your
      keyboard. What works, what doesn’t work? Why?

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      A web accessible to some is not a truly ‘world-wide web’. The best way to
      ensure the sites you create are accessible is to incorporate accessibility
      best practices from the start. While there are extra steps involved,
      incorporating these skills into your workflow now will mean all pages you
      create will be accessible.

      Take this HTML and rewrite it to be as accessible as possible, given the
      strategies you learned.

      Many governments have laws regarding accessibility requirements. Read up
      on your home country’s accessibility laws. What is covered, and what
      isn’t? An example is
