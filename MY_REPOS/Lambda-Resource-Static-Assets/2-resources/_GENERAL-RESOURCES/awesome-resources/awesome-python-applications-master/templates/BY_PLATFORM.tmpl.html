<h1 id="awesome-python-applications---by-platform">Awesome Python Applications - By Platform</h1>
<p>The same Awesome Python Applications you know and love, but arranged by <em>platform</em>. This list is for the app-happy reader looking to install everything their operating system supports.</p>
<p>But what can the rest of us learn from organizing Python by platform?</p>
<p>In practice, Python's history of building on the features of C has led to a wide range of deployment targets, from desktop operating systems, console interfaces, and even mobile platforms. Python's user and developer ecosystem is far from uniform, but by using the same language, we can more readily share packaging techniques and other platform-specific knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Status note</strong>: This dimension of the data is still under development. While the <em>Desktop</em> data is relatively complete, we're still on the lookout for more mobile and browser applications. Server platform targeting is still mostly general at the moment, needs more segmentation by distribution (i.e., Docker, etc.)</p>
