      Q1. You open a nested sequence in order to trim the length of a clip. You make the total duration of the clips
      longer.
      What happens to the duration of the nest in the main sequence?</h4>
    <ul>

      <li>[ ] Nesting makes it easier to reduce clutter in the Project panel, saving time and potentially project
        budget.
      </li>
      <li>[✅] Nesting allows a single effect to be applied to everything that is inside the nest, like a color
        correction or
        a video limiter.</li>
      <li>[ ] Nesting helps Adobe Premiere Pro render faster.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) is a prioritization model used to sequence jobs (eg., Features, Capabilities,
      and
      Epics) to produce the maximum economic benefit. In a flow-based system, priorities are updated continuously to
      provide
      the best economic outcomes. Job sequencing, rather than individual job return on investment, produces the best
      result.
      To that end, WSJF is used to prioritize backlogs by calculating the relative CoD and job size (a proxy for the
      duration). <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/">(Source)</a></p>

    <p>It is suggested that high business value, high-risk items are worked on first. While that may seem
      counterintuitive,
      the earlier this work is done, the sooner the team will move to mitigate the issues and unknowns—leading to a
      higher
      quality product. If there's a failure, it will occur early and relatively inexpensively. <a

      Q3. Your database is an RDS instance running SQL Server with Multi-AZ replication and you have several older .NET
      console utilities that perform database operations every 15 seconds. When the cluster has to switch the primary
      database server to the secondary AZ, the .NET utilities start to report connection failures to the database
      although
      other applications are able to access the database. How do you correct this problem?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] Use the RDS console to force a reboot of the database instance so that the primary server becomes the
        master
        server again.</li>
      <li>[ ] The server running the .NET utilities is caching the DNS lookup on the database cluster address. Flush the
        DNS
        cache of the server and force the C# utilities to open new connections to the database.</li>
      <li>[ ] A.NET application will retain the IP address of a connection string until the host machine is rebooted.
      </li>
      <li>[✅] The NET utilities need to change the SQL Server endpoint in the connection strings to read from the
        secondary
        database server using a try/catch.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>[ ] Use the billing dashboard to create a cost budget. Input the max amount you want to be charged each month.
        Any
        charges that occur over this amount will cause AWS to automatically suspend those resources</li>
      <li>[ ] Using the root AWS account, activate IAM access to the billing information for the account. Make sure your

      to
      the server from your local computer. What steps do you take to resolve this issue?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] Create a security group rule that allows all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. This will verify whether or not
        another
        rule is denying the traffic.</li>
      <li>[✅] Verify that the assigned security groups allow traffic from your IP address to port 5432. Verify that
        PostgreSQL is configured to listen to external traffic and is bound to the public interface.</li>
      <li>[ ] Make sure that you are using an Elastic IP and that it is included within the <code>postgresql.conf</code>
        configuration file.</li>
      <li>[ ] Stop and start the instance. New security group rules will only take effect after a restart.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>[✅] Use the instance storage to serve temporary files that require low I/O latency.</li>
      <li>[ ] Use the instance storage to handle files uploaded by your users. Since it is more secure than an EBS
        volume,
        you can isolate any malicious files from infecting your server.</li>
      <li>[ ] Instance storage is faster than EBS volumes, so install the root of the operating system on this volume to
        speed up server performance.</li>

      Q31. What's the best practice for horizontally scaling a legacy ASP.NET web application that relies on Active
      Directory and is currently deployed to a single Windows EC2 instance?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[✅] Use Sysprep to shut down the instance during a maintenance window. Create an AMI image and place both
        servers
        behind Application Load Balancer with sticky sessions.</li>
      <li>[ ] Launch a new EC2 with the latest version of Windows Server and install the application again. Use
        Application
        Load Balancer and sticky sessions to balance between both servers.</li>

      Q50. Your web application is getting a suspicious amount of bad requests from foreign IP addresses. Your business
      is
      operating in only a few countries and you would like to block any other traffic. What is the best practice for
      limiting access to your web application by country?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[✅] Use Web Application Firewall and create a geo match condition to drop all requests from countries that
        aren't
        on your allow list.</li>
      <li>[ ] Use Application Load Balancer to create a new routing rule that looks at source IP address. Add an IP
        block
        for the countries that have access.</li>
      <li>[ ] Host the front end of your website in CloudFront and configure a geo restriction on the distribution.</li>
      <li>[ ] Use CloudTrail to monitor the IP addresses of the bad requests. Use Lambda to add these IP addresses to an
        Application Load Balancer rule that blocks the IPs.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>[ ] Turn on auto update in Windows Update on each EC2 that is launched, or create your own AMI with this
        feature
        enabled and launch all of your EC2 instances from this AMI.</li>
      <li>[ ] Create a maintenance schedule that an employee must fill out each week confirming a visual inspection of
        each
        instance was conducted and which patches were applied.</li>
      <li>[✅] Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to find an patch instances that require updates during a set

      Q53. What happens to a SQL Server RDS instance if the databases increase in size and go over the allocated space?
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] RDS will automatically increase the allocated space by 10% and will send the AWS root account an email
        with
        resolution steps. Allocate more space to avoid overage charges.</li>
      <li>[✅] The database instance will report a STORAGE_FULL status and become inaccessible if the instance does not
        have
        enough remaining storage to operate. Allocate more space to the instance.</li>
      <li>[ ] SQL Server will close all existing connections to the databases and attempt to shrink its log files to
        reclaim
        storage space.</li>
      <li>[ ] RDS will automatically increase the allocated space by 5% and will continue to allocate new space up to
        50% of

    <ul>
      <li>[ ] Use a Network Load Balancer to distribute the traffic across your servers. Use UDP health checks to
        determine
        if the server is available to receive traffic.</li>
      <li>[✅] Use Route 53 with HTTP health checks. Create an application on the server to report the readiness status
        of
        the vendor-provided server software to Route 53 via HTTP.</li>
      <li>[ ] Use Route 53 with UDP health checks. As you scale up, Route 53 wiwll route the traffic to the new servers

    <ul>
      <li>[ ] The outbound rules block UDP port 53, so the server will not be able to resolve any DNS lookups.</li>
      <li>[✅] The outbound rules do not allow for HTTP traffic to leave the instance, so inbound HTTP requests will fail
        because the clients will never get HTTP responses.</li>
      <li>[ ] The incoming SSH port should not be open to the public. Limit SSH to a single IP address or IP range of
        controlled addressed, or use a VPN to access the VPC for this server.</li>
      <li>[ ] The all incoming TCP ports are exposed, which overrides the HTTP and SSH rules and exposes all TCP ports

    <p>Ubuntu EC2 instance configured as a web server?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] All traffic on all ports is being denied into this instance, which overwrites the HTTP rule and makes it

      <li>[ ] The instance was launched with the default security group, but there is no way for an administrator to SSH

      Which of

    <ul>
      <li>[ ] While pointers are variable that hold memory address, iterators are generic functions used to traverse
        containers. These function allows the programmer to implement read and write code as the container is traversed.
      </li>
      <li>[✅] Incrementing an iterator always means access the next element in the container(if any), no matter the
        container. Incrementing the pointer means pointing to the next element in memory, not always the next element.
      </li>
      <li>[ ] Pointers are variables that hold memory address where as iterator are unsigned integers that refers to
        offsets
        in arrays.</li>
      <li>[ ] All iterator are implemented with pointers so all iterators are pointers but not all pointers are
        iterators.

    <ul>
      <li>[ ] It is the same as the class member access operator, or arrow operator <code>(-&gt;)</code>, which allows
        you
        to access a member of an object through a pointer to the object.</li>
      <li>[✅] It is the pointer to member operator, and it allows you to access a member of an object through a pointer
        to
        that specific class member.</li>
      <li>[ ] It is the member access with address of operator, which returns the address of a class or struct member.
      </li>
      <li>[ ] It is a combination of the member access operator <code>(.)</code> and the dereference operator
        <code>(*)</code>, so it allows you to access the object that a member pointer points to.

    <p><code>git merge --squash HEAD@{1}</code> HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous command
      (again,

      from
      that commit. This whole operation could be a way to take 5 commits from a branch in which you started a new
      feature

        title="See this in the GIT&#39;s book">Patching</a>). As a new commit is created upon feature-user-location,
      HEAD
      also changes to match it. You can see this in <code>cat .git/HEAD</code> and
      <code>cat .git/refs/heads/feature-user-location</code> for this case. See <code>man git-cherry-pick</code> for
      details.

    </ul>
    <p>This is a confusing question and there can be an arguments for both the second and the third options being
      correct.
      From <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr">MDN</a>: The HTML
      <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>
      element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements. Historically, this has been presented as a
      horizontal rule or line. While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is
      now
      defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should
      do
      so using appropriate CSS.

    <h4 id="q1.-given-the-string-strawberries-saved-in-a-variable-called-fruit-what-would-fruit.substring2-5-return">Q1.
      Given the string "strawberries" saved in a variable called fruit, what would <code>fruit.substring(2, 5)</code>
      return?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] rawb</li>
      <li>[✅] raw</li>
      <li>[ ] awb</li>
      <li>[ ] traw</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The substring method is accepting two arguments. The first argument being the index
      to
      start(includes that char at 2) and the second the index of the string to end the substring(excludes the char at
      5).
      Strings in Java are like arrays of chars. Therefore the method will return "raw" as those are the chars in indexes
      2,3, and 4. You can also take the ending index and subtract the beginning index from it, to determine how many
      chars
      will be included in the substring (5-2=3).</p>

      Why
      is it usually better to work with Objects instead of Arrays to store a collection of records?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] Objects are more efficient in terms of storage.</li>
      <li>[ ] Adding a record to an object is significantly faster than pushing a record into an array.</li>
      <li>[✅] Most operations involve looking up a record, and objects can do that better than arrays.</li>
      <li>[ ] Working with objects makes the code more readable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Records in an object can be retrieved using their key which can be any given value
      (e.g. an employee ID, a city name, etc), whereas to retrieve a record from an array we need to know its index.</p>

    <p>// I find that answer somewhat vague and unsettled. Small number of matchings does not necessarily implies that
      the
      model overfits, especially given 500 (!) independent variables. To me, it sounds more reasonable that the
      threshold
      (matching) criterion might be too tight, thus allowing only a small number of matching to occur. So a solution can
      be
      either softening the threshold criterion or increasing the number of candidates.</p>

    <p>#### Q51. What is a reference to an object? - [ ] It is the address of variable only – not the method of an
      object. -
      [ ] It is a shallow pointer that conatins address of an object. - [ ] It is the physical address of an object. -
      [x]
      It is the address where the variables and methods of an object are stored.</p>
    <p>#### Q52. Why is unit testing harder in OOP than functional programming? - [✅] Objects may maintain internal
      state,
      which is not easily accessible by the tests. - [ ] The quality of unit testing frameworks for functional languages
      is
      better. - [ ] OOP promotes code reuse, which means that your tests have to consider more use cases. - [ ]
      Object-oriented languages tend to rely on frameworks such as Spring or Hibernate, which make them difficult to
      test.
    </p>
    <p>#### Q53. What is the function of a user diagram? - [ ] It connects actors to use cases. - [✅] It links actors to
      roles played in all use cases. - [ ] It lists all actors for each use case. - [ ] It minimizes the number of
      actors
      required.</p>
    <p>#### Q54. How do object behaviour and attributes differ? - [ ] Behaviour describe dynamic properties; attributes
      are
      static. - [✅] Attributes describ a state; behaviours describe a change. - [ ] Attributes apply only to a specified
      object; behaviour apply to other linked objects. - [ ] Behaviours are vector quantities; attributes are scalars.

    <p>For this the correct option should be <strong>Attributes apply only to a specified object, behaviors apply to
        other
        linked objects</strong></p>
    <p>Attributes are the individual things that differentiate one object from another and determine the appearance,
      state,
      or other qualities of that object.</p>
    <p>A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will "react" if asked
      to do
      something by another class or object or if its internal state changes.</p>
    <p>For Example: A motorcycle class might include the following attributes and have these typical values ( That are
      specific):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Color: red, green</li>
      <li>Style: cruiser, sport bike</li>
      <li>Brand: Honda, BMW</li>

    <p>Here are some behaviors that the Motorcycle class might have (applied to other linked objects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>[✅] The runtime is O(n) because in the worst case, the node you are searching for is the last node, and every
        node
        in the linked list must be visited.</li>

    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] A class method holds all of the data for a particular class.</li>
      <li>[✅] A class method can modify the state of the class, but it cannot directly modify the state of an instance
        that
        inherits from that class.</li>
      <li>[ ] A class method is a regular function that belongs to a class, but it must return <code>None</code></li>

    <ul>
      <li>[✅] For any given Node in a binary Search Tree, the child node to the left is less than the value of the given
        node and the child node to its right is greater than the given node. (Not Sure)</li>
      <li>[ ] Binary Search Tree cannot be used to organize and search through numeric data, given the complication that
        arise with very deep trees.</li>
      <li>[ ] The top node of the binary search tree would be an arbitrary number. All the nodes to the left of the top
        node
        need to be less than the top node's number, but they don't need to ordered in any particular way.</li>
      <li>[ ] The smallest numeric value would go in the top most node. The next highest number would go in its left
        child
        node, the the next highest number after that would go in its right child node. This pattern would continue until
        all
        numeric values were in their own node.</li>

        object
        oriented programming.</li>
      <li>[ ] A decorator is a visual indicator to someone reading your code that a portion of your code is critical and
        should not be changed.</li>
      <li>[✅] You use the decorator to alter the functionality of a function without the without having to modify the
        functions code.</li>

    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] You do not have to alter the state of the element the algorithm is recursing on.</li>
      <li>[ ] You would eventually get a KeyError when the recursive portion of the code ran out of items to recurse on.

      runtime
      complexity of searching for an item in a binary search tree?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] The runtime for searching in a binary search tree is O(1) because each node acts as a key, similar to a
        dictionary.</li>
      <li>[ ] The runtime for searching in a binary search tree is O(n!) because every node must be compared to every
        other

    <h4 id="q66.-why-would-you-use-mixin">Q66. Why would you use <code>mixin</code>?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] You use a <code>mixin</code> to force a function to accept an argument at runtime even if the argument
        wasn't
        included in the function's definition.</li>
      <li>[ ] You use a <code>mixin</code> to allow a decorator to accept keyword arguments.</li>
      <li>[ ] You use a <code>mixin</code> to make sure that a class's attributes and methods don't interfere with
        global
        variables and functions.</li>
      <li>[✅] If you have many classes that all need to have the same functionality, you'd use a <code>mixin</code> to
        define that functionality.</li>

      keyword?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] The <code>with</code> keyword lets you choose which application to open the file in.</li>
      <li>[ ] The <code>with</code> keyword acts like a <code>for</code> loop, and lets you access each line in the file
        one

        collaorate
        remotely.</li>
      <li>[ ] Virtual environments were common in Python 2 because they augmented missing features in the language.
        Virtual
        environments are not necessary in Python 3 due to advancements in the language.</li>

      Which statement correctly describes a difference between the form helper methods <code>form_tag</code> and
      <code>form_for</code>?
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] The <code>form_tag</code> method is for basic forms, while the <code>form_for</code> method is for
        multipart
        forms that include file uploads.</li>
      <li>[ ] The <code>form_tag</code> method is for HTTP requests, while the <code>form_for</code> method is for AJAX
        requests.</li>
      <li>[✅] The <code>form_tag</code> method typically expects a URL as its first argument, while the
        <code>form_for</code> method typically expects a model object.
      </li>
      <li>[ ] The <code>form_tag</code> method is evaluated at runtime, while the <code>form_for</code> method is
        precompiled and cached.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>[ ] Filters are called before a request hits the DispatcherServlet.They allow for interception-style, chained
        processing of web requests for security, timeouts, and other purposes.</li>
      <li>[ ] Filters are used with a checksum algorithm that will filter invalid bytes out of a byte stream request
        body
        and allow for processing of HTTP requests from the DispatcherRequestServlet.</li>
      <li>[ ] Filters are used with a checksum algorithm that will filter invalid bytes out of an octet stream a
        multipart
        upload and allow for chained processing of WebDispatcherServlet requests.</li>
      <li>[✅] Filters are used to validate request parameters out of the byte stream request body and allow for

        operate on it that is accessed via a URI.</li>
      <li>[ ] A REST service has a pool of resources composed of allocations of memory that allow a request to be
        processed.
      </li>
      <li>[ ] A resource for a REST service is an explicit allocation of a thread or CPU cycles to allow a request to be

        chain
        that intercept calls to the instance and computed SQL on the fly.</li>
      <li>[✅] A JDK proxy instance is created, which backs the repository interface, and a MethodInterceptor intercepts
        calls to the instance and routes as required.</li>
      <li>[ ] The Spring JDK proxy creates a separate runtime process that acts as an intermediary between the database
        and
        the Web server, and intercepts calls to the instance and handles requests.</li>
      <li>[ ] Spring automatically generated code for you based on your XML config files that define a
        SpringMethodAutoGeneration factory that intercepts calls to the instance and creates dynamic method that

        languages.</li>
      <li>[✅] SpEL(Spring Expression Language) supports boolean and relational operators and regular expressions, and is
        used for querying a graph of objects at runtime.</li>
      <li>[ ] SpEL(Spring Expression Language) allows you to build, configure,and execute tasks such as building
        artifacts
        and downloading object dependencies.</li>

      proxies used in Spring?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>[✅] JDK Dynamic proxy can proxy only interface, so it is used if the target implements at least one interface.
        A
        CGLIB proxy can create a proxy by subclassing and is used if the target does not implement an interface.</li>
      <li>[ ] Only JDK Dynamic proxies are used in the Spring Bean Lifecycle. CGLIB proxies are used only for
        integrating
        with other frameworks.</li>

        on
        proper validation</li>
      <li>[✅] It creates a proxy that implements the same interface(s) as the annotated class, allowing Spring to inject
        behaviors before, after, or around method calls into the object being proxied.</li>

#### Q24. You have a search bar on your site. You would like to use a `&lt;label&gt;` to make the word &quot;Search&quot; visible to screen readers, but you don&#39;t want to display the word &quot;Search&quot; on the screen. How can you accomplish this?
- [ ] Assign an ARIA state of &quot;hidden&quot; to the label, like this: `&lt;label state=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;search&quot; id=&quot;search&quot; /&gt;`
- [✅] Use the built-in WordPress CSS class .screen-reader-text to hide the text from screen, like this: `&lt;label class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;search&quot; id=&quot;search&quot; /&gt;`
- [ ] Create a custom CSS class to set a large negative value to the text-indent property to hide the text off screen, like this: `&lt;label class=&quot;hide-this&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;search&quot; id=&quot;search&quot; /&gt;`
- [ ] The majority of users do not require a screen reader. Remove the label entirely.

#### Q25. You might see this code in a WordPress plugin. What does it do?</code></pre>
    <p>if ( ! defined( ‘ABSPATH' ) ) { die; }</p>
    <pre><code>- [ ] This is how WordPress detects a plugin&#39;s presence. This ensures that the plugin is running from the /wp-content/plugins/ directory. If it is not, the plugin should not run.
- [✅] This is a way to prevent naming collisions. ABSPATH is the absolute path to the plugin&#39;s directory. If ABSPATH is defined by another WordPress plugin with the same directory slug, the plugin should not run.
- [ ] This is a security measure. ABSPATH is the absolute path to the WordPress directory. If the file is called directly, ABSPATH will not be defined and therefore the plugin should not run.
- [ ] This is a compatibility checker. ABSPATH is defined in WordPress core. The plugin checks that the minimum version of WordPress needed to support the plugin is installed. If it is not, the plugin should not run.

#### Q26. Which is a best practice for working with WordPress CSS?

#### Q28. What is the difference between an action and a filter?
- [ ] Actions are used to add custom functions and remove WordPress functions. Filters are used to make strings translatable for localization.
- [✅] Actions are used to add or remove code at runtime. Filters are used to modify data before it is either displayed in the browser or saved to the database.
- [ ] Actions are used to assign values to variables at runtime. Filters are used to extract data from actions and display it in the browser.
- [ ] Actions are used to add user-inputted data to the database. Filters are used to validate user-inputted data prior to adding it to the database.

#### Q29. If you activate or update a plugin and it breaks your site so that you cannot manage it via wp-admin, how can you disable the plugin?
- [✅] all of these answers
- [ ] Access the WordPress install via WP-CLI. Run the following command: wp plugin deactivate offending-plugin.
- [ ] Access site files via FTP and navigate to /wp-content/plugins/. Delete the folder of the plugin that you would like to disable or simply rename it.
- [ ] Use phpMyAdmin to change the wp_options table&#39;s active_plugins option value to a:0:{}.

#### Q30. The WordPress REST API is designed to receive and respond to particular types of requests using basic HTML methods.
