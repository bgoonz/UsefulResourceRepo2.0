#### Q24. You have a search bar on your site. You would like to use a `&lt;label&gt;` to make the word &quot;Search&quot; visible to screen readers, but you don&#39;t want to display the word &quot;Search&quot; on the screen. How can you accomplish this?
- [ ] Assign an ARIA state of &quot;hidden&quot; to the label, like this: `&lt;label state=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;search&quot; id=&quot;search&quot; /&gt;`
- [✅] Use the built-in WordPress CSS class .screen-reader-text to hide the text from screen, like this: `&lt;label class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;search&quot; id=&quot;search&quot; /&gt;`
- [ ] Create a custom CSS class to set a large negative value to the text-indent property to hide the text off screen, like this: `&lt;label class=&quot;hide-this&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;search&quot; id=&quot;search&quot; /&gt;`

#### Q25. You might see this code in a WordPress plugin. What does it do?</code></pre>
<p>if ( ! defined( ‘ABSPATH' ) ) { die; }</p>
<pre><code>- [ ] This is how WordPress detects a plugin&#39;s presence. This ensures that the plugin is running from the /wp-content/plugins/ directory. If it is not, the plugin should not run.
- [✅] This is a way to prevent naming collisions. ABSPATH is the absolute path to the plugin&#39;s directory. If ABSPATH is defined by another WordPress plugin with the same directory slug, the plugin should not run.
- [ ] This is a security measure. ABSPATH is the absolute path to the WordPress directory. If the file is called directly, ABSPATH will not be defined and therefore the plugin should not run.
- [ ] This is a compatibility checker. ABSPATH is defined in WordPress core. The plugin checks that the minimum version of WordPress needed to support the plugin is installed. If it is not, the plugin should not run.

#### Q26. Which is a best practice for working with WordPress CSS?

- [ ] Actions are used to assign values to variables at runtime. Filters are used to extract data from actions and display it in the browser.
- [ ] Actions are used to add user-inputted data to the database. Filters are used to validate user-inputted data prior to adding it to the database.

#### Q29. If you activate or update a plugin and it breaks your site so that you cannot manage it via wp-admin, how can you disable the plugin?
- [✅] all of these answers
