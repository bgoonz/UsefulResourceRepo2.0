  <p>Like a Swiss Army Knife, Windows 10 was designed to do just about everything for everyone…or at least that’s
    Microsoft’s hope. It’s built to provide a unified operating system that can run across multiple platforms, such as
    PCs, tablets, and smartphones. It’s also designed to provide PC users with a more traditional Windows experience
    compared to Windows 8’s touch-centric UI, something Microsoft hopes will win over long-time Windows users and many
    IT departments that skipped Windows 8. Lastly, Windows 10 marks the beginning of Microsoft’s Windows-as-a-service
    strategy, which could signal the end of numbered Windows releases.</p>
  <p>To help IT leaders get up to speed on Windows 10, we compiled the most important details and related resources on
    Microsoft’s latest operating system into this guide, which we’ll periodically update it as new information becomes
    available. This article is also available as a download, <a

  <p>The Windows 10 October 2020 Update, also known as Windows 10 version 20H2, released to the public on Oct. 20, 2020.
    This release fixes several bugs in the operating system and adds a few notable quality-of-life features. For
    example, version 20H2 includes the Chromium-based version of the Microsoft Edge web browser, making it the official
    default browser for Windows 10. Version 20H2 also streamlines the Start Menu and makes more changes to the Settings
    Control Panel.</p>

  <p>As of May 27, 2020, Windows 10, Version 2004, became available to mainstream users. The 20H1 update of Windows 10
    included several new user-friendly features, numerous bug fixes, and new tools for developers. </p>
  <p>On the developer’s side, an updated version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux will convert the system from a
    translation layer to a virtual machine running Microsoft’s Linux kernel. In addition, admins now have better and
    more feature-rich update optimization tools.</p>
  <p>Users will notice an improvement in Bluetooth and other wireless connectivity, as well as enhancements to GPU
    monitoring and management. The Cortana digital assistant is no longer an integral part of the operating system–it’s
    now a separate app.</p>

  <p>The Windows 10 November 2019 Update was made “… <a

      to the Release Preview ring</a> of the Windows Insider Program on October 14, 2019,” states ZDNet contributing
    writer Ed Bott. Windows 10 Version 1909 was released to the general public on November 12, 2019.</p>

    opportunity to choose if and when they would like to install it. This marked a major change in the way Microsoft
    deploys Windows 10 update packages—one major update in the Spring of each year and one smaller maintenance update in
    the Fall of each year.</p>
  <p>Many of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/at-home/whats-new-wip-at-home-1909">new
      features in the Windows 10 November 2019 Update</a> are behind-the-scenes improvements to general performance and

  <h3 id="windows-10-october-2018-update">Windows 10 October 2018 Update</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/windows-10-october-2018-update-what-you-need-to-know/">Windows 10
      October 2018 Update</a> is considered an evolution of the original Windows 10 release. With editions for home
    users, business professionals, and for enterprise, it offered a mix of features for every user working across PCs
    and tablets.</p>
  <p>Microsoft had slowly been evolving the Windows user interface to take advantage of more natural ways of working
    with a computer. The mouse and keyboard are still there, but screens are more touch-friendly, with a powerful
    on-screen keyboard powered by the same underlying machine learning system as the familiar mobile <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/swiftkey">SwiftKey</a>. There’s also support for eye tracking, for
    Microsoft’s own rotary <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-dial/925r551sktgn?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Dial</a>, and for
    on-screen pens.</p>
  <p>Each new release adds new interaction models, as Microsoft takes advantage of its <a
      href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-overview">Windows-as-a-Service</a> model to
    push out regular small changes that over time add up to a new Windows. The old numbered and named releases have gone
    away, as have the themed semi-annual updates. Now Windows gets its name from the month it’s released, just like the
    Xbox gaming platform.</p>

        fail: Microsoft keeps customers in the dark</a> (ZDNet)</strong></p>
  <p>1809 is the last of the Redstone series of Windows 10 releases. Originally codenamed RS5, it added new dark mode UI
    elements, as well as a wider implementation of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/">Fluent
      design style</a>, across both the OS and Windows 10’s built-in applications. Other new features include deeper
    integration with Android phones via the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/microsoft-your-phone/">Your Phone</a>
    app, improved screen capture tools, a cloud-hosted clipboard, plus changes to the Start menu search experience and
    the Cortana virtual assistant.</p>
  <p>This release also introduced a <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-windows-10-enterprise-support/">business-friendly
      support model</a>, with support for the September/October releases extended to 30 months, with 18 months support
    for the March/April releases. It’s a change that will make it easier for businesses and users that want to update
    Windows every one or two years, without having to go to the feature-limited Long Term Servicing (LTS) release. Other
    Enterprise updates include new sign-in and security tooling, and the policies to ensure they can be managed and
    deployed to all users.</p>
  <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What is Windows 10?</strong> Windows 10 is the latest major release of Microsoft’s Windows operating
      system and is the successor to Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1. Windows 10 includes support for tablets and <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/internet-of-things-iot-cheat-sheet/">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>
      devices. It remains backwards compatible with software written for most earlier versions of Windows and DOS, and
      has added support for Linux applications and for Arm processors as well as Intel and AMD x86 hardware.</li>
    <li><strong>Why does Windows 10 matter?</strong> Windows 10 contains a host of new features, security updates, and a
      platform-unifying design aimed at both enterprise users and consumers. Windows remains Microsoft’s flagship
      product, and is still the dominant PC operating system. By switching to a semi-annual release schedule, it’s able
      to add features and support new services building on a familiar platform and user interface. Microsoft calls this
      delivery model Windows-as-a-Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Who does Windows 10 affect?</strong> Windows 10 is available from the Microsoft Store and from other
      retailers, and it will be the default operating system of many newly purchased computers and electronic devices.
      Windows 10 is now installed on around 1 billion devices. With an accelerated delivery model, Microsoft is aiming
      to bring as many users as possible to the new release as quickly as possible.</li>
    <li><strong>When was Windows 10 released?</strong> Microsoft made Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro generally
      available on July 29, 2015 through a staggered release schedule. Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Education
      editions were made available beginning on August 1, 2015. Microsoft released the <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/windows-10-spring-creators-update-a-cheat-sheet/">Windows 10 April
        2018 Update</a> on May 30, 2018 and began rolling it out to customers on a staggered basis. The <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/windows-10-october-2018-update-what-you-need-to-know/">Windows 10
        October 2018 Update</a> began rolling out in October 2018 but was delayed due to severe bugs; as of December
      2018, the rollout was back on track. The Windows 10 May 2019 Update became generally available on May 21, 2019.
      The Windows 10 November 2019 Update became generally available on Nov. 12, 2019. On May 27, 2020, the Windows 10
      May 2020 Update became available to mainstream users. The Windows 10 October 2020 Update became generally
      available on Oct. 20, 2020.</li>
    <li><strong>How can I get Windows 10?</strong> Windows 10 is available to purchase through the <a
        href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/b/windows">Microsoft Store</a> and through other retailers, with
      downloads from the Windows 10 website via Microsoft’s <a
        href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/Windows10">media creation tool</a>. This can install
      Windows 10 on PCs directly or create bootable USB installation drives. ISO files are also available for DVD
      installation. Upgrades to 1809 from previous Windows 10 releases will come via Windows’ built-in update tool.</li>

  <h2 id="what-is-windows-10">What is Windows 10?</h2>
  <p>Officially unveiled on Sept. 30, 2014, Windows 10 is the current major release of Microsoft’s Windows operating
    system and is the successor to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. </p>
  <p>Developed under the codename “Threshold” with later builds coming from the “Redstone” branch, Microsoft’s goal with
    Windows 10 is to provide a common operating system that can run across multiple platforms–including PCs, tablets,
    smartphones, embedded systems, and even Xbox One, Surface Hub, and HoloLens. Each platform has a device-specific
    user interface (UI), but shares the same Windows 10 core.</p>

      alt="1-first-build-9841-start.png" />
    <figcaption>1-first-build-9841-start.png</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Windows 10 includes several new features and important changes, in addition to its platform-unifying design. Many
    new features are designed to improve the desktop experience and draw in business users who were turned off by
    Windows 8’s tile-based UI and the initial removal of the Start menu. Key features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start menu:</strong> Windows 10’s Start menu combines the Windows 7-like application list and the live
      tiles interface from Windows 8’s Start screen. Windows-8 style “modern” apps (now called <a
        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide">Universal
        Windows Platform</a> or UWP apps) can run within a window on the desktop, like standard desktop programs. There
      is also support for apps developed with the <a
        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-root">Windows 10 Desktop Bridge</a>,
      which lets Windows Win32 applications take advantage of Windows 10 features including Live Tiles. A new wider
      application launch view in the October 2018 Update gives you access to more application options, and improves
      application search.</li>
    <li><strong>Action Center:</strong> The Charms menu is replaced with the Action Center, a sidebar that provides
      notifications and contains buttons for common tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Tablet mode:</strong> A new tablet mode is designed to make Windows 10 easier to operate without a
      keyboard or a mouse. From the October 2018 Update, the on-screen keyboard is powered by the same technology as
      Microsoft’s Android and iOS SwiftKey.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved security:</strong> New security features include Windows Hello, an integrated biometric
      authentication system, and <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/securing-microsofts-edge-browser-with-windows-defender-application-guard/">Windows
        Defender Application Guard</a>, which runs the Edge browser in its own Hyper-V isolated process.</li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Edge:</strong> Formerly codenamed Project Spartan, Edge is the default web browser in Windows
      10. With the release of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, the Edge browser now supports extensions, greatly
      increasing the flexibility of the browser. Internet Explorer 11 is included with the OS, but is basically
      unchanged from the version of IE11 found in Windows 7 and 8.1. Edge is also Windows’ built-in PDF viewer and ePub
      ebook reader. The underlying EdgeHTML engine is a modern HTML 5 browser, with support for most modern web
      standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Cortana integration:</strong> <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-cortana-a-smart-persons-guide/">Cortana</a>, Microsoft’s
      voice-powered personal assistant, makes its desktop debut in Windows 10 and can be configured to take over the
      Search box. It now also works with Amazon’s Alexa and with a range of home automation hardware. The October 2018
      Update gives Cortana and Windows Search a new, wider search look-and-feel with additional search options. However,
      some features, like parcel tracking, are being moved from Cortana into other Windows applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Xbox Live integration:</strong> Although not critical for many business users, Xbox Live is built into
      Windows 10. Users can stream games from an Xbox One to a desktop, laptop, or tablet over Wi-Fi, play multiplayer
      games with people on different platforms, and more. A built-in Game Bar mode allows full-screen recording, which
      works with desktop apps as well as games.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced graphics:</strong> Windows 10 includes new versions of DirectX and WDDM to improve game
      performance. Workstation apps can also use these features to access GPU hardware for additional compute
      performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Above the login screen:</strong> The Windows 10 Anniversary Update (1607) allows users to access several
      applications, including Cortana and the Calendar app, without having to log in first.</li>
    <li><strong>3D Paint app:</strong> The <a
        href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/windows-10-creators-update-the-smart-persons-guide/">Windows 10
        Creators Update</a> (1703) added a new 3D Paint app, which allows users to more easily create and share 3D
      scenes and models.</li>
    <li><strong>Windows Timeline and Shared Experiences:</strong> With the April 2018 Update (1803), Windows Timeline
      added cross-system support for shared activities, showing what Office documents you’ve worked on and which web
      pages you’ve visited. You can resume work through Cortana, and pick up web browsing sessions from another PC–and
      also send browser sessions from mobile devices to the desktop. A new Your Phone app in the October 2018 Update
      brings recent photographs and SMS messages from your Android phone to your desktop. As of December 2018, the
      rollout was again back on track and the update should have been applied to all devices by early 2019. The official
      rollout began in late May 2019.</li>
    <li><strong>Snip &amp; Sketch:</strong> Microsoft used the October 2018 Update to deliver a new version of its
      screen capture tooling. Use Shift+Win+S to launch a new screen capture experience, with a pen-enabled editing tool
      to edit and annotate your captures.</li>
    <li><strong>Sticky Notes:</strong> Originally part of the <a
        href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17207/windows-10-use-windows-ink">Windows Ink Workspace</a>, <a
        href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/microsoft-sticky-notes/9nblggh4qghw#activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Sticky
        Notes</a> is now an app in its own right, with a major update promised that will integrate it with Windows’
      other note-taking and task management tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Clipboard:</strong> Windows now offers a clipboard history that works across devices logged into
      the same Microsoft account, using the same <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph">Microsoft
        Graph</a> that powers the Timeline.</li>
    <li><strong>UI improvements:</strong> Microsoft is moving away from the flat look of Windows 8 with a more natural
      Fluent Design language. This adds translucency and new animations, and is slowly being rolled out across Windows
      and its various core applications. Closely related is a “dark mode” for Windows, with a new dark version of
      Windows Explorer.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage Sense:</strong> Microsoft has replaced the old Disk Cleanup utility with a new application,
      Storage Sense. This new tool automatically deletes old cached and temporary files from your storage devices to
      free up space for new files. The automated management of hard drive storage will increase the overall performance
      of a Windows 10 device without requiring interaction with users.</li>
    <li><strong>Windows Calendar:</strong> It has been a long time coming, but with the October 2018 Update, Microsoft
      finally added a much-needed search feature to the Windows Calendar app. Users can now type in a few key words to
      find their appointments, even if they were added to the calendar by Cortana.</li>
    <li><strong>Windows Sandbox:</strong> The Windows 10 May 2019 Update added a new containerization feature to the Pro
      and Enterprise versions that allows executable applications to be tested by running them in a safe isolated
      version of Windows 10. Through configuration users can even block the Sandbox from accessing networks and the
      internet. Closing the Sandbox will remove the application and its remnants.</li>
    <li><strong>Reserved Storage:</strong> With the May 2019 Update, Windows 10 now has the ability to hold 7 GB of hard
      disk storage in reserve for use during system maintenance. Clean Windows 10 installs after the May 2019 Update
      activate this feature automatically. Previously installed versions of Windows 10 updated to version 1903 are
      required to manually activate the feature.</li>
    <li><strong>Cortana search separation:</strong> The May 2019 Update separated Cortana and the standard search box on
      the Taskbar. Cortana digital assistant interaction now has its own icon, while the search box remains on the
      Taskbar as before.</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Improved Start menu:</strong> The May 2019 Update and the Windows 10 October 2020 Update further
        refined the look and feel of the Windows 10 Start Menu. The new and improved Start menu should have less
        automatically installed tiles, and the layout should seem much less cluttered and more streamlined.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Chromium-based Microsoft Edge:</strong> With the Windows 10 May 2019 Update, the Microsoft Edge web
        browser became a Chromium-based open source application, opening Edge up to more third-party plugin development.
        The Windows 10 October 2020 Update made the Chromium-based Edge browser the official default browser of Windows
        10.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Linux file system:</strong> The May 2019 Update added support for Linux files directly into the Windows
      10 File Explorer application.</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Personalized Taskbar:</strong> With the Windows 10 October 2020 Update, users can personalize the
        pinning feature of the Taskbar to better suit their priorities and user style.</p>

  <h2 id="why-does-windows-10-matter">Why does Windows 10 matter?</h2>
  <p>Windows 10 is Microsoft’s effort to recapture many enterprise users who balked at Windows 8’s mobile-focused
    interface and to finally move the last Windows XP and Vista holdouts onto a newer OS.</p>
  <p>Windows 10 builds on Windows 7 and on Windows 8, mixing a familiar user interface with mobile and touch-friendly
    user elements. With Windows XP and Vista no longer supported, and Windows 7 close to end-of-life, it’s intended to
    be both an upgrade from older Windows releases and the OS on new Windows PCs. With new security features and a
    built-in store, it also brings a new set of modern application development APIs in the shape of the cross-platform
    UWP.</p>
  <p>Beyond the new features, security updates, and its platform-unifying design, Windows 10 marks a significant shift
    in how Microsoft’s characterizes its flagship operating system. Microsoft is encouraging people to think of Windows
    10 as a “service.” The Windows as a Service delivery model allows Microsoft to regularly deliver new features as
    part of a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows-10/release-information">semi-annual delivery
      model</a>.</p>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="https://www.techrepublic.com/a/hub/i/r/2015/07/30/9d6fd263-64fb-4111-8f19-105424db0cb1/resize/770x/832ffa5ed32d15030ec6c20d426bce04/win10updatepaths.jpg"
      alt="win10updatepaths.jpg" />
    <figcaption>win10updatepaths.jpg</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>April/May releases will be supported for 18 months, and September/October releases will be supported for 30 months.
    Alongside the regularly updated releases, Microsoft also offers a long-term servicing branch that’s intended for
    critical applications that require minimal updates, and which will be supported for 10 years.</p>
  <p>Windows 10 Home users only get access to the Current Branch of Windows, which is delivered via the Windows Update
    service. There’s no way of directly delaying or disabling updates to Windows Home, as Microsoft intends for home
    users to have the most secure version of Windows possible.</p>
  <p>Similarly, Windows 10 Pro allows access to Current Branch releases and the Current Branch for Business. Using the
    Current Branch for Business, you can delay major updates until they’ve been tested and approved. However, security
    updates will be installed automatically. Education users get the same options as Windows 10 Pro.</p>
  <p>Windows 10 Enterprise adds support for the Long Term Servicing Branch, though with LTSB there’s no access to the
    Windows Store, Cortana, or Edge. Most of the other Windows 10 default applications aren’t included either, and
    aren’t supported even if sideloaded. New releases come every 2-3 years.</p>

        the basic Windows 10 keyboard shortcuts: Clever things you can do with keyboard settings</a>
      (TechRepublic)</strong></p>
  <p>Microsoft changed the names used for the different Windows 10 channels as part of aligning Windows 10 with both
    Office 365 and Microsoft 365. Current Branch is now referred to as Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted), Current Branch
    for Business is the Semi-Annual Channel, while the Long Term Servicing Branch is now the Long Term Servicing
    Channel.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-enroll-in-the-windows-insider-program/">Insider channels</a>
    give early access to new features, but should only be used for test machines or by enthusiasts. Skip Ahead is for
    early access to the next major build of Windows, with Slow and Fast rings giving access to the current development
    builds. A Release Preview option gives early access to drivers and security updates, allowing IT departments to
    qualify updates in advance of wider availability. Microsoft actively suggests that IT departments keep a selection
    of machines on the different Insider rings in order to ensure that key applications are compatible and to set
    development targets for new Windows SDK releases.</p>

  <p>Windows 10 general availability (GA) began on July 29, 2015, with Microsoft adopting a staggered deployment
    schedule.</p>
  <p>Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Education editions were made available beginning on August 1, 2015 through
    Microsoft’s Volume Licensing Center (neither edition was included in the first-year-free program).</p>
  <p>The Windows 10 Anniversary Update was released on August 2, 2016. The update included new and better security
    features with improvements to applications like Windows Hello, Windows Defender, and Windows Information Protection.
    The Anniversary Update also augmented support for digital pens with the addition of Windows Ink, a built-in platform
    that can interpret input beyond the traditional mouse and keyboard. Microsoft Edge gained support for extensions,
    including AdBlock, Translator, and Office Online. Extensions allow developers to create apps inside Edge and greatly
    enhance the browser’s overall capabilities.</p>
