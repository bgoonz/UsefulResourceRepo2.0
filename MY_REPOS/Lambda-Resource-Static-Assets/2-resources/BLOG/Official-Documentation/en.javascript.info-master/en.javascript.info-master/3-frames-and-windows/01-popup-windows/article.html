<h1 id="popups-and-window-methods">Popups and window methods</h1>
<p>A popup window is one of the oldest methods to show additional document to user.</p>
<p>Basically, you just run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="va">window</span>.<span class="at">open</span>(<span class="st">&#39;https://javascript.info/&#39;</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>…And it will open a new window with given URL. Most modern browsers are configured to open url in new tabs instead of separate windows.</p>
<p>Popups exist from really ancient times. The initial idea was to show another content without closing the main window. As of now, there are other ways to do that: we can load content dynamically with <a href="info:fetch">fetch</a> and show it in a dynamically generated <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. So, popups is not something we use everyday.</p>
<p>Also, popups are tricky on mobile devices, that don’t show multiple windows simultaneously.</p>
<p>Still, there are tasks where popups are still used, e.g. for OAuth authorization (login with Google/Facebook/…), because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A popup is a separate window which has its own independent JavaScript environment. So opening a popup from a third-party, non-trusted site is safe.</li>
<li>It’s very easy to open a popup.</li>
<li>A popup can navigate (change URL) and send messages to the opener window.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="popup-blocking">Popup blocking</h2>
<p>In the past, evil sites abused popups a lot. A bad page could open tons of popup windows with ads. So now most browsers try to block popups and protect the user.</p>
<p><strong>Most browsers block popups if they are called outside of user-triggered event handlers like <code>onclick</code>.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="co">// popup blocked</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2"><span class="va">window</span>.<span class="at">open</span>(<span class="st">&#39;https://javascript.info&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-4" title="4"><span class="co">// popup allowed</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-5" title="5"><span class="va">button</span>.<span class="at">onclick</span> <span class="op">=</span> () <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-6" title="6">  <span class="va">window</span>.<span class="at">open</span>(<span class="st">&#39;https://javascript.info&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-7" title="7"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>This way users are somewhat protected from unwanted popups, but the functionality is not disabled totally.</p>
<p>What if the popup opens from <code>onclick</code>, but after <code>setTimeout</code>? That’s a bit tricky.</p>
<p>Try this code:</p>
<p><code>js run // open after 3 seconds setTimeout(() =&gt; window.open('http://google.com'), 3000);</code></p>
<p>The popup opens in Chrome, but gets blocked in Firefox.</p>
<p>…If we decrease the delay, the popup works in Firefox too:</p>
<p><code>js run // open after 1 seconds setTimeout(() =&gt; window.open('http://google.com'), 1000);</code></p>
<p>The difference is that Firefox treats a timeout of 2000ms or less are acceptable, but after it – removes the “trust”, assuming that now it’s “outside of the user action”. So the first one is blocked, and the second one is not.</p>
<h2 id="window.open">window.open</h2>
<p>The syntax to open a popup is: <code>window.open(url, name, params)</code>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>url</dt>
<dd>An URL to load into the new window.
</dd>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>A name of the new window. Each window has a <code>window.name</code>, and here we can specify which window to use for the popup. If there’s already a window with such name – the given URL opens in it, otherwise a new window is opened.
</dd>
<dt>params</dt>
<dd>The configuration string for the new window. It contains settings, delimited by a comma. There must be no spaces in params, for instance: <code>width=200,height=100</code>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Settings for <code>params</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Position:
<ul>
<li><code>left/top</code> (numeric) – coordinates of the window top-left corner on the screen. There is a limitation: a new window cannot be positioned offscreen.</li>
<li><code>width/height</code> (numeric) – width and height of a new window. There is a limit on minimal width/height, so it’s impossible to create an invisible window.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Window features:
<ul>
<li><code>menubar</code> (yes/no) – shows or hides the browser menu on the new window.</li>
<li><code>toolbar</code> (yes/no) – shows or hides the browser navigation bar (back, forward, reload etc) on the new window.</li>
<li><code>location</code> (yes/no) – shows or hides the URL field in the new window. FF and IE don’t allow to hide it by default.</li>
<li><code>status</code> (yes/no) – shows or hides the status bar. Again, most browsers force it to show.</li>
<li><code>resizable</code> (yes/no) – allows to disable the resize for the new window. Not recommended.</li>
<li><code>scrollbars</code> (yes/no) – allows to disable the scrollbars for the new window. Not recommended.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a number of less supported browser-specific features, which are usually not used. Check <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.open">window.open in MDN</a> for examples.</p>
<h2 id="example-a-minimalistic-window">Example: a minimalistic window</h2>
<p>Let’s open a window with minimal set of features, just to see which of them browser allows to disable:</p>
<p>``<code>js run let params =</code>scrollbars=no,resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no, width=0,height=0,left=-1000,top=-1000`;</p>
<p>open(‘/’, ‘test’, params); ```</p>
<p>Here most “window features” are disabled and window is positioned offscreen. Run it and see what really happens. Most browsers “fix” odd things like zero <code>width/height</code> and offscreen <code>left/top</code>. For instance, Chrome open such a window with full width/height, so that it occupies the full screen.</p>
<p>Let’s add normal positioning options and reasonable <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>top</code> coordinates:</p>
<p>``<code>js run let params =</code>scrollbars=no,resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no, width=600,height=300,left=100,top=100`;</p>
<p>open(‘/’, ‘test’, params); ```</p>
<p>Most browsers show the example above as required.</p>
<p>Rules for omitted settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is no 3rd argument in the <code>open</code> call, or it is empty, then the default window parameters are used.</li>
<li>If there is a string of params, but some <code>yes/no</code> features are omitted, then the omitted features assumed to have <code>no</code> value. So if you specify params, make sure you explicitly set all required features to yes.</li>
<li>If there is no <code>left/top</code> in params, then the browser tries to open a new window near the last opened window.</li>
<li>If there is no <code>width/height</code>, then the new window will be the same size as the last opened.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accessing-popup-from-window">Accessing popup from window</h2>
<p>The <code>open</code> call returns a reference to the new window. It can be used to manipulate it’s properties, change location and even more.</p>
<p>In this example, we generate popup content from JavaScript:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> newWin <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">window</span>.<span class="at">open</span>(<span class="st">&quot;about:blank&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;hello&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="st">&quot;width=200,height=200&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" title="3"><span class="va">newWin</span>.<span class="va">document</span>.<span class="at">write</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>And here we modify the contents after loading:</p>
<p>```js run let newWindow = open(‘/’, ‘example’, ‘width=300,height=300’) newWindow.focus();</p>
<p>alert(newWindow.location.href); // (*) about:blank, loading hasn’t started yet</p>
<p>newWindow.onload = function() { let html = <code>&lt;div style="font-size:30px"&gt;Welcome!&lt;/div&gt;</code>; <em>!</em> newWindow.document.body.insertAdjacentHTML(‘afterbegin’, html); <em>/!</em> }; ```</p>
<p>Please note: immediately after <code>window.open</code>, the new window isn’t loaded yet. That’s demonstrated by <code>alert</code> in line <code>(*)</code>. So we wait for <code>onload</code> to modify it. We could also use <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> handler for <code>newWin.document</code>.</p>
<p>```warn header=“Same origin policy” Windows may freely access content of each other only if they come from the same origin (the same protocol://domain:port).</p>
<p>Otherwise, e.g. if the main window is from <code>site.com</code>, and the popup from <code>gmail.com</code>, that’s impossible for user safety reasons. For the details, see chapter <a href="info:cross-window-communication" class="uri">info:cross-window-communication</a>. ```</p>
<h2 id="accessing-window-from-popup">Accessing window from popup</h2>
<p>A popup may access the “opener” window as well using <code>window.opener</code> reference. It is <code>null</code> for all windows except popups.</p>
<p>If you run the code below, it replaces the opener (current) window content with “Test”:</p>
<p>```js run let newWin = window.open(“about:blank”, “hello”, “width=200,height=200”);</p>
newWin.document.write( "
<script>
<p>window.opener.document.body.innerHTML = ‘Test’&lt;/script&gt;" ); ```</p>
<p>So the connection between the windows is bidirectional: the main window and the popup have a reference to each other.</p>
<h2 id="closing-a-popup">Closing a popup</h2>
<p>To close a window: <code>win.close()</code>.</p>
<p>To check if a window is closed: <code>win.closed</code>.</p>
<p>Technically, the <code>close()</code> method is available for any <code>window</code>, but <code>window.close()</code> is ignored by most browsers if <code>window</code> is not created with <code>window.open()</code>. So it’ll only work on a popup.</p>
<p>The <code>closed</code> property is <code>true</code> if the window is closed. That’s useful to check if the popup (or the main window) is still open or not. A user can close it anytime, and our code should take that possibility into account.</p>
<p>This code loads and then closes the window:</p>
<p>```js run let newWindow = open(‘/’, ‘example’, ‘width=300,height=300’);</p>
<p>newWindow.onload = function() { newWindow.close(); alert(newWindow.closed); // true }; ```</p>
<h2 id="moving-and-resizing">Moving and resizing</h2>
<p>There are methods to move/resize a window:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>win.moveBy(x,y)</code></dt>
<dd>Move the window relative to current position <code>x</code> pixels to the right and <code>y</code> pixels down. Negative values are allowed (to move left/up).
</dd>
<dt><code>win.moveTo(x,y)</code></dt>
<dd>Move the window to coordinates <code>(x,y)</code> on the screen.
</dd>
<dt><code>win.resizeBy(width,height)</code></dt>
<dd>Resize the window by given <code>width/height</code> relative to the current size. Negative values are allowed.
</dd>
<dt><code>win.resizeTo(width,height)</code></dt>
<dd>Resize the window to the given size.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There’s also <code>window.onresize</code> event.</p>
<p><code>warn header="Only popups" To prevent abuse, the browser usually blocks these methods. They only work reliably on popups that we opened, that have no additional tabs.</code></p>
<p>```warn header=“No minification/maximization” JavaScript has no way to minify or maximize a window. These OS-level functions are hidden from Frontend-developers.</p>
<p>Move/resize methods do not work for maximized/minimized windows. ```</p>
<h2 id="scrolling-a-window">Scrolling a window</h2>
<p>We already talked about scrolling a window in the chapter <a href="info:size-and-scroll-window" class="uri">info:size-and-scroll-window</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>win.scrollBy(x,y)</code></dt>
<dd>Scroll the window <code>x</code> pixels right and <code>y</code> down relative the current scroll. Negative values are allowed.
</dd>
<dt><code>win.scrollTo(x,y)</code></dt>
<dd>Scroll the window to the given coordinates <code>(x,y)</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>elem.scrollIntoView(top = true)</code></dt>
<dd>Scroll the window to make <code>elem</code> show up at the top (the default) or at the bottom for <code>elem.scrollIntoView(false)</code>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There’s also <code>window.onscroll</code> event.</p>
<h2 id="focusblur-on-a-window">Focus/blur on a window</h2>
<p>Theoretically, there are <code>window.focus()</code> and <code>window.blur()</code> methods to focus/unfocus on a window. And there are also <code>focus/blur</code> events that allow to catch the moment when the visitor focuses on a window and switches elsewhere.</p>
<p>Although, in practice they are severely limited, because in the past evil pages abused them.</p>
<p>For instance, look at this code:</p>
<p><code>js run window.onblur = () =&gt; window.focus();</code></p>
<p>When a user attempts to switch out of the window (<code>window.onblur</code>), it brings the window back into focus. The intention is to “lock” the user within the <code>window</code>.</p>
<p>So browsers had to introduce many limitations to forbid the code like that and protect the user from ads and evils pages. They depend on the browser.</p>
<p>For instance, a mobile browser usually ignores <code>window.focus()</code> completely. Also focusing doesn’t work when a popup opens in a separate tab rather than a new window.</p>
<p>Still, there are some use cases when such calls do work and can be useful.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we open a popup, it’s might be a good idea to run a <code>newWindow.focus()</code> on it. Just in case, for some OS/browser combinations it ensures that the user is in the new window now.</li>
<li>If we want to track when a visitor actually uses our web-app, we can track <code>window.onfocus/onblur</code>. That allows us to suspend/resume in-page activities, animations etc. But please note that the <code>blur</code> event means that the visitor switched out from the window, but they still may observe it. The window is in the background, but still may be visible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Popup windows are used rarely, as there are alternatives: loading and displaying information in-page, or in iframe.</p>
<p>If we’re going to open a popup, a good practice is to inform the user about it. An “opening window” icon near a link or button would allow the visitor to survive the focus shift and keep both windows in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>A popup can be opened by the <code>open(url, name, params)</code> call. It returns the reference to the newly opened window.</li>
<li>Browsers block <code>open</code> calls from the code outside of user actions. Usually a notification appears, so that a user may allow them.</li>
<li>Browsers open a new tab by default, but if sizes are provided, then it’ll be a popup window.</li>
<li>The popup may access the opener window using the <code>window.opener</code> property.</li>
<li>The main window and the popup can freely read and modify each other if they have the same origin. Otherwise, they can change location of each other and <a href="info:cross-window-communication">exchange messages</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To close the popup: use <code>close()</code> call. Also the user may close them (just like any other windows). The <code>window.closed</code> is <code>true</code> after that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Methods <code>focus()</code> and <code>blur()</code> allow to focus/unfocus a window. But they don’t work all the time.</li>
<li>Events <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> allow to track switching in and out of the window. But please note that a window may still be visible even in the background state, after <code>blur</code>.</li>
</ul>
