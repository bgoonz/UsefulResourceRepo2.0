<h1 id="react">React</h1>
<p>You’ve been using what we call <em>vanilla JavaScript</em> (often referred to as <em>Vanilla.js</em>) to build your front-end applications. And, you may have noticed that it’s <em>hard</em>. Creating strings to put new DOM into the page <em>should</em> be easier.</p>
<p>In this article, you will find out more about React and why you should consider using it as a way to build separate front-end apps.</p>
<h2 id="a-front-end-timeline">A front-end timeline</h2>
<p>Lots of JavaScript/CSS libraries and frameworks have been invented to ease the pain of front-end development. Here’s an abbreviated list of some of the more noteworthy ones in chronological order. Please click on each of the links and just quickly browse each of these libraries’ Web sites to get a feel for the functionality each provides you.</p>
<ul>
<li>[script.aculo.us]: (2005) This is one of the first libraries that started easing this by adding special effects and dynamic content for client-side development.</li>
<li>[dojo]: (2005) This toolkit added a log of non-visual and visual components that allowed developers to rapidly develop AJAX-enabled applications.</li>
<li>[YUI]: (2006) A full framework that provided dynamic loading of scripts, events, visual components, data binding, and a philosophy on how to build client-side applications.</li>
<li>[Knockout]: (2010) This is a standalone JavaScript implementation of the [Model-View-ViewModel] pattern used to build very fast dynamic components for client-side applications. It is the progenitor of many other libraries, include React.</li>
<li>[AngularJS]: (2011) This framework from Google built on the success of Knockout and introduced a full set of utilities and philosophies to build modular client-side applications. (The current version has been branded [Angular].) In the rewrite of Angular to make the idea of a component a first-order concept, many developers left and joined the React community.</li>
<li>[Elm]: (2012) This is an entirely new <em>language</em> used to build front-end applications. You write your
    front-end application in Elm. Then, you "compile" it. The Elm "compiler" translates all of the source code written
    in Elm to highly-tuned JavaScript so that it runs really fast in your Web browser. It claims that by using Elm that
    your front-end code will have "no runtime exceptions" which is a bold (and mostly true) claim.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="react-2013">React (2013)</h2>
<p>In an effort to make its own Web front-end more maintainable, Facebook decided to build its own JavaScript-based library to create fast and functional front-end Web applications. Thus, React was born.</p>
<p>React manages the <strong>creation and updating of DOM nodes in your Web page</strong>. It does not do AJAX. It does not do services. It does not do local storage. It does not provide a pretty CSS framework for you. It just dynamically renders stuff into the DOM</p>
<p>Because of Facebook’s immense popularity as a developer-centric organization, React was quickly adopted across the software-development industry, eclipsing the use of all other front-end libraries and frameworks for many years. React is still considered the <em>standard</em> front-end library to use to build modern Web applications.</p>
<p>React is <em>unopinionated</em> about many aspects of front-end development. It doesn’t care how you make AJAX calls. It doesn’t really care about how your page is laid out. It has a few simple rules that you must follow, and <em>It Just Works</em>. You’ll learn about those in the next article, <em>React Concepts and Features</em>.</p>
<p>Working with plain old React became a real chore for anything non-trivial, so they invented a new language to help write React applications. That language is called JSX, or JavaScript eXtension. It looks like a mixture of JavaScript and HTML (technically, XML).</p>
<p>Instead of writing Vanilla.js like this to create some DOM elements based on some data that comes back from an API call. Don’t worry about understanding what you see. You will get the opportunity to learn more about all of this in later articles, lectures, and projects.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="at">fetch</span>(<span class="st">&#39;https://example.com/api/people&#39;</span>)</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-7" title="7">    <span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-8" title="8">    html <span class="op">+=</span> <span class="st">&#39;&lt;/ul&gt;&#39;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-9" title="9">    <span class="va">document</span>.<span class="at">querySelector</span>(<span class="st">&#39;#people-list&#39;</span>).<span class="at">innerHTML</span> <span class="op">=</span> html<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-10" title="10">  <span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You would write something like this using JSX.</p>
<pre class="jsx"><code>function PeopleList(props) {
  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      {props.people.map(person =&gt; (
        &lt;li&gt;{person.lastName}, {person.firstName}&lt;/li&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  );
}

const peopleListElement = document.querySelector(&#39;#people-list&#39;);
fetch(&#39;https://example.com/api/people&#39;)
  .then(response =&gt; response.json())
  .then(people =&gt; {
    const props = { people };
    ReactDOM.render(&lt;PeopleList props={props}/&gt;, peopleListElement);
  });</code></pre>
<p>In this "simple" example, you may think, "Well, that’s like twice the code! Why would I do that?" Great question!
    When you start building <em>lots of components</em>, lots of different pieces of visual widgets to put together to
    manage a complex graphical human interface, it becomes really nice to put each of those functions (or classes) into
    their own files and <em>organize</em> the code so you know where everything is.</p>
<h2 id="using-tools-with-react">Using tools with React</h2>
<p>Oh, and the tools! Because software developers constantly look for ways to make things easier, the tools that have grown up around React are amazing. You’ll install React DevTools, a new tab in the Developer Tools that lets you see how React actually works in the browser, much like the <em>Elements</em> tab does for just HTML elements.</p>
<p>[React DevTools]</p>
<p>There is <code>create-react-app</code>, an extensible command-line tool that helps you generate standard React applications. We’ll show you how to use it with custom templates, too, to help remove some of the over-engineered stuff that comes with the standard template.</p>
<p>Because browsers only understand JavaScript and not JSX, there is an extra "build step" involved with creating React-based front-end applications. There are a variety of tools that software developers use to make this happen. The most popular, right now, is to use a tool called [Webpack]. Later this week, you’ll get into some of the details about how that works.</p>
<p>[Webpack.js]</p>
<p>A really popular feature of modern React development is the concept of <em>hot module replacement</em> (HMR). When you make changes to your source code, right now, you must refresh your browser to see the changes. HMR sense what has changed and send the change to the browser without you having to refresh it. The changes are delivered in <em>real-time</em>, updating the UI for you as you make changes to the source code. It is almost magic what happens.</p>
<p>After using React on their own massively complex Web interface, React developers decided they did need to have an opinion about how to architect the state of their application, that is, how to allow discretely different parts of their Web page to consume and modify data received from back-end APIs. This introduced the <em>Flux architecture</em> which you will learn about next week.</p>
<p>[Flux]</p>
<h2 id="choosing-react">Choosing React</h2>
<p>Because of the tools, because of the popularity, because (seemingly) <em>everyone</em> knows React, choosing React to power your front-end is an easy choice. Hundreds of thousands of other software developes know and love React. Tens of thousands of companies use React on their Web sites and to power their Web applications. App Academy’s own learning platform that you’re reading this on uses React as the way to render content.</p>
<p>There are other viable modern alternatives to React. However, they are almost all heavily influenced by React’s design and implementation. Learning them is like learning React and different parts of its vibrant ecosystem. React has really become the stick by which all other front-end libraries are measured. And will likely continue to hold that position for the near future.</p>
<h2 id="what-youve-just-seen">What you’ve just seen</h2>
<p>In this article, you’ve discovered that React is one of many front-end libraries that you can use to build dynamic data-driven front-end JavaScript-based modern Web applications. You’ve seen that React has its own language, JSX, to easily write React applications. In addition to an easy-to-use language to write in, the React team and community have created a bunch of tools and utilities for you to use and add to your React application; these will help you inspect and debug your application as you build it. React is a <em>safe</em> choice because you learn about it here and in hundreds of other places. ________________________________________________________________________________ # React Concepts And Features</p>
<p>In this article, you will gain insight into why you may want to use React for the front-end portion of your application, the part that runs in the browser, as opposed to using plain-old vanilla JavaScript, that is, just the JavaScript found in the browser.</p>
<h2 id="modularity">Modularity</h2>
<p>Unlike the mess of code that you can create with event listeners and template strings in your JavaScript code to manipulate the DOM by adding, updating, and removing elements from it, React provides modularity from the ground up. If you see modularity, understanding where code is that’s running, then React is for you.</p>
<h2 id="easy-to-start">Easy to start</h2>
<p>You don’t need any special tools to use basic React. You can just import some files and get to work using the <code>createElement</code> method that React provides to define reusable "components" for what appears in the browser. They can be as simple as a really cool button, or as complex as Facebook’s Web UI.</p>
<p>For more complex applications, there are may tools available to you to get a fully-functioning React application running from a single command on the command line, tools such as <em>Create React App</em>. This handy tools will create a full React application with live reload, testing, and support for things like advanced CSS manipulation.</p>
<h2 id="declarative-programming">Declarative programming</h2>
<p>In the same way that you use HTML to <em>declare</em> what the user interface should look like, React provides the same mechanism in its element-based programming API, either through the <code>createElement</code> method or the higher-level language known as JSX.</p>
<h2 id="reusability">Reusability</h2>
<p>React encourages you to think in terms of reusability as you construct the user interface from elements and components that you create. It works best when you think of the page as pieces of UI working in harmony with one another. When you make a list or a button or a product card, you can then reuse those components to show different data that your UI demands to show.</p>
<h2 id="one-flow-of-data">One-flow of data</h2>
<p>React applications are built as a combination of parent and child components. As the names suggest, each child component has a parent and a parent component will have one or more child components. Components receive data via an argument traditionally named <code>props</code>. Parent components can decide the data that its children should show by passing only a subset of what it has to its children. Data is never passed up from the child to the parent. Because you always know which way data flows, you can more easily debug your application to determine where the data display or event handling code is.</p>
<h2 id="the-virtual-dom">The "virtual DOM"</h2>
<p>You may have come to the conclusion that writing things like</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1"><span class="va">el</span>.<span class="at">innerHTML</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="vs">`</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" title="2"><span class="vs">  &lt;table&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" title="3"><span class="vs">    &lt;tbody&gt;`</span> <span class="op">+</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" title="4">      <span class="va">arr</span>.<span class="at">map</span>(item <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> <span class="vs">`&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;</span><span class="sc">${</span><span class="va">item</span>.<span class="at">name</span><span class="sc">}</span><span class="vs">&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;`</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-5" title="5">    <span class="op">+</span> <span class="vs">`&lt;/tbody&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-6" title="6"><span class="vs">  &lt;/table&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-7" title="7"><span class="vs">`</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>is hard to debug, maintain, and use in the long run. React solves this problem by providing a virtual DOM (in memory) that acts as an agent between the developer and the real DOM. The virtual DOM is a lot more user-friendly for developers.</p>
<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>
<p>Due to the use of a virtual DOM, React handles changes to a Web page more intelligently than just string manipulation. It is constantly monitors the virtual DOM for changes. It very efficiently reconciles changes in the virtual DOM with what it has already produced in the real DOM. This is what makes React one of the speediest front-end libraries available.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-learned">What you learned</h2>
<p>You’ll learn more about these in the upcoming videos and over the next couple of days. Happy Reacting!</p>
<p>You found out that React has a variety of good points that encourage you to choose it as the means to build your front-end:</p>
<ul>
<li>React encourages modular development</li>
<li>React is easy to use, easy to start with, and has some great tools</li>
<li>React follows the declarative programming style</li>
<li>React encourages reusability in your code</li>
<li>React has one way that data flows, which makes it much easier to reason about the code</li>
<li>React uses a "virtual DOM" to make changes to the real DOM very fast and efficient</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="intro-to-es6-modules">Intro to ES6 Modules</h1>
<p>Now, you will learn more about ES6 module syntax and how it is used to export and import items between different files. You’ll compare the differences between managing exports with ES6 module syntax vs CommonJS module syntax. At the end of this article, you will understand how to manage your exports and imports with ES6’s:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>export default</code> statement to export one item per file</li>
<li><code>export</code> keyword to export multiple items per file</li>
<li><code>import ... from</code> statement to import items from one file to another</li>
<li><code>export default</code> statement to export an unnamed item and rename the item in an import statement</li>
<li><code>as</code> keyword (in an <code>import ... from</code> statement) to <em>alias</em> and <em>namespace</em> all of a file’s exported items</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exporting-one-item-per-file">Exporting one item per file</h2>
<p>You cannot export multiple items per file by using an <code>export default</code> statement with ES6 module syntax. For instance, the example below will only export the <code>Wallet</code> class from the file.</p>
<p><strong>ES6 modules</strong></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1"><span class="im">export</span> <span class="im">default</span> <span class="kw">class</span> Wallet <span class="op">{</span></a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" title="3"><span class="op">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-5" title="5"><span class="co">// sayHello will not be exported</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-6" title="6"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">sayHello</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-7" title="7">  <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&#39;Hello!&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-8" title="8"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>export default</code> statement is equivalent to using <code>module.exports</code> to directly export <strong>one</strong> item from a file using (instead of an object).</p>
<p><strong>CommonJS modules</strong></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" title="1"><span class="kw">class</span> Wallet <span class="op">{</span></a>

<h2 id="exporting-multiple-items-per-file">Exporting multiple items per file</h2>
<p>You can export multiple items per file by using the <code>export</code> keyword (<strong>without</strong> the <code>default</code> keyword) with ES6 module syntax. Using ES6’s export, you have two options for exporting items. You can export each item as you define it. With ES6 modules, the preferred method to export multiple functions or classes from a single file is to export each function or class as it’s defined.</p>
<p><strong>ES6 modules (parts of an export)</strong></p>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-11" title="11"><span class="op">};</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can refer to each item by name and export them all within an object. This is the unpreferred method to export multiple functions or classes.</p>

<p>Using ES6’s <code>export</code> keyword is similar to how you can export classes and functions as individual parts of an export or an export object with CommonJS module syntax. Unlike with ES6 modules, the preferred method to export multiple items from a single file with CommonJS modules is to export an object with <code>module.exports</code>.</p>

<p>Although calls to the <code>require</code> method can be anywhere in a JavaScript file using CommonJS modules, this is not the case for ES6 modules. For ES6 modules, the <code>import</code> statements must always be at the top of the file because imports have to occur before the rest of the file’s code runs.</p>

<h2 id="unnamed-default-imports">Unnamed default imports</h2>
<p>You can give unnamed items that are exported with <code>export default</code> any name you want when importing them. For example, imagine if you <code>export default</code> a <code>Wallet</code> class from a file name <code>wallet.js</code>. When you import the <code>Wallet</code> class into <code>newFile.js</code>, you can rename the <code>Wallet</code> class because of how you used <code>export default</code> to export the class from the <code>wallet.js</code> file.</p>

<p>However, if you used the <code>export</code> instead of <code>export default</code>, you are using a named export. With named exports, the import names have to exactly match.</p>

<p>You can use an asterisk (<code>*</code>) to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#Import_an_entire_modules_contents">import an entire module’s contents</a>. Note that you must alias your imported object using the <code>as</code> keyword to be able to refer to it later. Aliasing can be used to namespace all the exported functions, constants, etc. from a file to wrap them into a single, easily referenced object.</p>

<p>You can also use aliasing to rename identically named functions or items from different files. For example, take the two <code>Wallet</code> classes below. Both classes are named <code>Wallet</code>, but they come from different files. The <code>Wallet</code> from the <code>wallet1</code> file is aliased as <code>W1</code> while the <code>Wallet</code> from the <code>wallet2</code> file is aliased as <code>W2</code> to differentiate between the two <code>Wallet</code> classes.</p>

<h2 id="browser-support-for-es6-modules">Browser support for ES6 Modules</h2>
<p>ES6 modules can only be used when a file is specified as a <code>module</code>. You can use an HTTP server to serve an HTML file with a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag of <code>type="module"</code>. By running a local web server, you gain browser support for ES6 module syntax by using a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in an HTML file to specify a JavaScript file as an ES6 module (not just a normal JavaScript file). Note the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag of <code>type="module"</code> below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb18-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;script</span><span class="ot"> type=</span><span class="st">&quot;module&quot;</span><span class="ot"> src=</span><span class="st">&quot;./wallet.js&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="mini-project">Mini-project</h3>
<p>Follow the guidelines below to use an HTTP server and import JavaScript files with ES6 module syntax:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a folder with an <code>index.html</code> file. Fill in the file with the contents below. Note the use of the <code>type="module"</code> attribute in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. You must include the <code>.js</code> file extension in the name of the module (<code>./program.js</code>). The browser needs to know the entire name of the JavaScript file it will be loading from a server. <code>html  &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;    &lt;title&gt;Browser&lt;/title&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;    &lt;button id="button"&gt;Start Game&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;div id="message"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;script type="module" src="./program.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;</code></li>
<li><p>Create a <code>game.js</code> file with the contents below: ```js export class Game { constructor() { this.gameStartMessage = "Hello! Do you want to play a game?"; }</p>
start() { document .getElementById(‘button’) .addEventListener(‘click’, () =&gt; { const messageContainer = document.getElementById(‘message’); messageContainer.innerText = this.gameStartMessage; }); } } ```</li>
<li><p>Create a <code>program.js</code> file with the contents below: ```js import { Game } from ‘./game.js’;</p>
window.addEventListener(‘DOMContentLoaded’, () =&gt; { const game = new Game(); game.start(); }); ```</li>
<li>Make sure you are in the directory of your HTML and JavaScript files set up an HTTP server with <code>python3 -m http.server</code> to serve the <code>index.html</code> file to the browser.</li>
<li>When the browser reads the <code>index.html</code> file, it will read the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and know that the JavaScript file is using ES6 module syntax (<code>type="module"</code>) to load the <code>program.js</code> file.</li>
<li>The browser will start reading the <code>program.js</code> file from top to bottom, reading the <code>import { Game } from './game.js';</code> statement first. Note that the <code>.js</code> file extension must be present for the browser to know the entire name of the JavaScript file to load from the server.</li>
<li><p>The browser will then load the <code>game.js</code> file and all the code in the loaded JavaScript files will run!</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-youve-learned">What you’ve learned</h2>
<p>In this reading, you learned about managing exports and imports with ES6 modules and how using ES6 modules compares to using CommonJS modules. You learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li>ES6 has <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> keywords (instead of <code>require</code> and <code>module.exports</code>)</li>
<li>ES6 <code>import</code> statements are always at the top of the file</li>
<li>The <code>export</code> keyword to exports multiple items from a file while the <code>export default</code> phrase exports <strong>one</strong> item from a file</li>
<li>You can rename an item that is exported with <code>export default</code></li>
<li>The <code>as</code> keyword can be used to alias an imported item</li>
<li>The <code>*</code> character can be used to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#Import_an_entire_modules_contents">import an entire module’s contents</a> with a namespace (<code>import * as Namespace from 'fileName.js';</code>)</li>
<li>ES6 modules can only be used when a file is explicitly specified as a <code>module</code>, either through an HTML file with a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag of <code>type="module"</code> or a <code>package.json</code> file with a <code>"type": "module"</code> field</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="show-and-tell">Show And Tell</h1>
<p>It’s time to show off all of the hard work that you’ve done! Great job! You worked as a team, pushed hard through the project, coordinated, collaborated, communicated.</p>
<p>You are a real software development team!</p>
<p>Each presentation should last around 15 minutes. Some things that you may want to highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way that you integrated front- and back-ends</li>
<li>Anything that you added that went beyond the bound of what you learned in class and how that went</li>
<li>Reflect on the goods and bads of the experience <em>as a team</em>, talk about what you would do differently if you could start over with all the knowledge you have, right now</li>
</ul>
