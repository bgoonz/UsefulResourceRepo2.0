<h2 id="airport-schema-instructions">Airport Schema Instructions</h2>
<p>You are in charge of implementing the schema found in database-schema.png. You will implement the database using SQL. After it, you will drop the database and implement it again using Sequelize.</p>
<p>Before you start, create a user called “airports_app" with a password and CREATEDB privileges.</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL Practice
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a database called “airports" with owner “airports_app"</li>
<li>Create the three tables in the schema “Airports", “Flights" and “Airplanes". Ensure that you capture the
    associations as foreign keys in your tables</li>
<li>Create a sql file with seed data from <code>data-seed.txt</code>. Seed your database.</li>
<li>Write the following queries in SQL</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Find all Flights departing before July 1, 2020</li>
<li>Find all airports, that have flights departing after before July 1, 2020</li>
<li>Find the model of all planes that will be departing from the airport with airportCode ‘YYC’</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sequelize Practice
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop the database called “airports"</li>
<li>Use sequelize to initialize a project</li>
<li>Update config/config.json with your “airports_app" user and the “airports" database</li>
<li>Utilize sequelize_cli model:generate to create the three Models that correspond to every table in the schema. Remember that <code>sequelize model:generate</code> takes the singular model names (“Airport", “Flight" and “Airplane") and will generate a migration file with the pluralized table names (“Airports", “Flights" and “Airplanes").</li>
<li>Update the migrations files with validations and references</li>
<li>Update the models with the associations in the schema</li>
<li>Utilize sequelize-cli seed:generate to create seed files for each Model, and migrate the data in <code>data-seed.txt</code> into these files.</li>
<li>Create a new file called <code>queries.js</code> in the top level of your application.</li>
<li>Require your three models:</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">const</span> <span class="op">{</span> Airport<span class="op">,</span> Flight<span class="op">,</span> Airplane <span class="op">}</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">&#39;models&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Using the Sequelize query syntax, prepare three functions that will return the values specified in these queries:</p>
<pre><code>- Find all Flights departing before July 1, 2020
- Find all airports, that have flights departing after before July 1, 2020
- Find the model of all planes that will be departing from the airport with airportCode &#39;YYC&#39;</code></pre>
