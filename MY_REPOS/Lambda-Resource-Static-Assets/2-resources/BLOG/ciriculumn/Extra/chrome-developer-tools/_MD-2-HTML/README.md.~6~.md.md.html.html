Sprint Challenge: User Interface and Git - Multi-Page Website
</h1>
<p>
This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored User Interface and Git. During this Sprint, you studied Semantic HTML, CSS Fundamentals, CSS Flexbox Module, and Git. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a multi page website that has some missing HTML elements as well as CSS specificity problems that need to be solved. You will also create an additional web page that will be linked to from a navigation you will build.

Instructions
</h2>
<p>
<strong>Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected <em>before</em> starting this Sprint Challenge.</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.
</p>
<p>
You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in semantic HTML, CSS fundamentals, CSS flexbox module, and git.
</p>
<p>
You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.
</p>
<h2 id="commits">
Commits
</h2>
<p>
Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.
</p>
<h2 id="description">
Description
</h2>
<p>
In this challenge, you build a missing header (navigation and image) on the home page, update some CSS styling on the home page, and create an additional page (About) which will link from the navigation you created.
</p>
<p>
In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your web page should look like the solution screen shots of the home and about pages:

Self-Study Questions
</h2>
<p>
Demonstrate your understanding of this week’s concepts by answering the following free-form questions.
</p>
<p>
Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Most tags come in pairs and Prettier won’t be able to work if your HTML is broken, so make sure for every needing opening tag you have a closing tag. You don’t need to memorize them because you’ll most likely either use cheatsheets or will remember it over a period of time due to frequent use.
</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>
Name two big differences between <code>display: block;</code> and <code>display: inline;</code>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<code>display: block;</code> aligns items vertically while <code>display: inline;</code> aligns items horizontally.
</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>
What are the 4 areas of the box model?
</li>

While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: <code>align-items: center</code>?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Cross axis, otherwise known as y-axis.
</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>
Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It gives an ability for multiple developers to work on a variety of features using the base at the same time while not breaking main code.
</p>
<p>
You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section <em>will</em> prevent you from passing this challenge.

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.
