Build A Portfolio Website
</h1>
<p>
With all of the projects you will be working on here at Lambda School, you will need somewhere to house them! There is no better opportunity to learn and show off your skills than a beautiful portfolio website.
</p>
<p>
You have the ability to write HTML, CSS, and responsive media queries. You also know how to identify and write responsive units. It’s time to put that knowledge into action by reading someone else’s code and adding your own flavor. You will be building a portfolio website from a template found on <a href="https://html5up.net/">https://html5up.net/</a>.

MVP Requirements
</h2>
<ul>

Some templates are much larger than others, you don’t need to fill in every little div with information, just try to get the site representing you and your work
</li>
<li>
You can use sites like <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">https://www.pexels.com/</a> for free images to fill in place holders
</li>
<li>
Showcase projects you have worked on by providing some information and links to your git hub projects

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
[ ] Implement proper attribution: Attribution is required under the <a href="https://html5up.net/license">creative commons license</a> that came with the website files you downloaded. Be sure to provide attribution somewhere in the site. The templates should already come with attribution found in most footers but double check to be sure.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Host your website for the world to see. Follow the instructions found here <a href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a>. Once you have hosted your web page, share it for your peers to see. This is not a small feat!
