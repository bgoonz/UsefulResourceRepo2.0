Assignment Description
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.
</li>
<li>
Use <code>console.log()</code> statements to check to see if your code does what it is supposed to do.
</li>
<li>
To test your <code>console.log()</code> statements open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>You could also run <code>node /assignments/&lt;fileName&gt;</code> and see what prints in your terminal.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Once you finish the exercises in each file, commit your code, and push it to your fork.
</li>
</ul>

Objects
</h3>
<p>
To better understand objects, you really just need to write more of them. The <a href="assignments/objects.js">objects.js</a> file contains several challenges centered around a theme of interns starting at a new job. The Human Resources team needs information about the new hires. Use your new found object skills to answer vital questions for HR.

Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges
</li>
<li>
Don’t work on stretch until you have completed all assignments
</li>
</ul>

Arrays
</h3>
<p>
The <a href="assignments/arrays.js">arrays.js</a> assignment takes us through a large data set of used cars. You have been asked to help a used car business with some customer requests based on their inventory. Use for loops and arrays to solve their problems.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Utilize the the array <code>inventory</code> to complete your challenges
</li>
<li>
Use any array method you see fit to solve the problem
</li>
<li>
Don’t work on stretch until you have completed all assignments
</li>
</ul>

Arrow Function Syntax
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Arrow Function Syntax - <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/when-and-why-you-should-use-es6-arrow-functions-and-when-you-shouldnt-3d851d7f0b26">Check out this awesome guide for ES6 arrow syntax</a>. You will see more and more arrow functions as you progress deeper into JavaScript. Use the <a href="assignments/function-conversion.js">function-conversion.js</a> file as a helper challenge to showcase some of the differences between ES5 and ES6 syntax.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stretch">
Stretch
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Move on to tomorrow’s content and start studying callbacks, write a few of your own to get the hang of it.
</li>
<li>
Look at array methods like .map(), .reduce(), .filter(). use them on the data in the arrays assignment to accomplish the same things you did with the ES5 for loop.
</li>
</ul>
