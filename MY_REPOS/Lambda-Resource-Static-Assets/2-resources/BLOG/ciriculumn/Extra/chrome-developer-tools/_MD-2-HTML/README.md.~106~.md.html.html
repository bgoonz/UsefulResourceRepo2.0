Sprint Challenge: Advanced React - Women’s World Cup
</h1>
<p>
This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past Sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored class components, custom hooks, and testing. In your challenge for this Sprint, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating an application that consumes data from an API using a custom hook, displays that data on the DOM, and tests your React components.
</p>
<p>
The data you will get back from the server will be the Women’s World Cup players ranked by search interest from Google Trends, June-July 2019, worldwide - https://googletrends.github.io/data/.

Instructions
</h2>
<p>
<strong>Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected <em>before</em> starting this Sprint Challenge.</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.
</p>
<p>
You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency with ReactJS Fundamentals and your command of the concepts and techniques in the Functional Components.
</p>
<p>
You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.
</p>
<h2 id="commits">
Commits
</h2>
<p>
Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your Team Lead.

Self-Study/Essay Questions
</h2>
<p>
Demonstrate your understanding of this Sprint’s concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit the <code>ANSWERS.md</code> file to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[X] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)? see Answers.md
</li>
<li>
[X] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes. see Answers.md
</li>
<li>
[X] What is the purpose of a custom hook? see Answers.md

<li>
[X] Add TL as collaborator on Github.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
[X] Run <code>yarn</code> to download dependencies.
</li>
<li>
[X] Run the server using <code>yarn start</code> or <code>node server.js</code>.

<li>
[X] In a separate terminal cd into the <code>client</code> folder and run <code>yarn install</code> to download dependencies.
</li>
<li>
[X] Still inside the <code>client</code> folder run <code>yarn start</code> to run the client application.
</li>
<li>
[X] Implement the project on this Branch, <strong>committing progress &amp; changes often.</strong>
</li>
<li>
[X] Push commits: <code>git push origin &lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Follow these steps for completing your project:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[X] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student’s Repo).
</li>
<li>
[X] Add your Project Manager as a Reviewer on the Pull-request.
</li>
<li>
[ ] PM then will count the HW as done by merging the branch back into master.
</li>
</ul>
