Connected Components in a Graph
</h1>
<p>
A <em>connected component</em> of a graph is a subgraph where all vertices are reachable via edges in the subgraph.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an example of a graph with 8 connected components:

<p>
(Two of the connected components are single verts.)

Usefulness of Connected Components
</h2>
<p>
There are a lot of theoretical uses of connected components that are beyond the scope of the course. But on the more practical front, here are some potential uses:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Look for people you might know in a social network.
</li>
<li>
Predict the spread of zombie apocalypse or other disease within social groups.
</li>
<li>
Determining which parts of a computer network are reachable from another.
</li>
<li>
Finding clusters of related information.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finding-connected-components">
Finding Connected Components
</h2>
<p>
If you have a BFS or DFS, finding connected components is pretty straightforward if you modify your search to return a list of verts visited. (Also modify the search to not always color the verts white at the start.)
</p>
<pre class="pseudocode"><code>connected_components = [];

for v in graph.vertexes:
  v.color = white

for v in graph.vertexes:
  if v.color == white:
    component = bfs(v)
    connected_components.push(component);</code></pre>
