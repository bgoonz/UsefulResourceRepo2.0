# Hello World

Hey Programmer! Welcome to the JavaScript module. In the next few sections,
we'll be learning the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language. If
it's your first time programming, don't worry; we designed this course
especially for you. We'll have you executing your first lines of code in no
time!

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

- use the `console.log` command to print out messages
- use double slashes (`//`) to write code comments

## Getting visual feedback in your programs

The first command we'll learn in JavaScript is `console.log`. This command is
used to _print_ something onto the screen. As we write our first lines of code,
we'll be using `console.log` frequently as a way to visually see the output of
our programs. Let's write our first program:

```javascript
console.log("hello world");
console.log("how are you?");
```

Executing the program above would print out the following:

```plaintext
hello world
how are you?
```

Nothing too ground breaking here, but pay close attention to the exact way we
wrote the program. In particular, notice how we lay out the periods,
parentheses, and quotation marks. We'll also terminate lines with semicolons
(;).

> Depending on how you structure your code, sometimes you'll be able to omit
> semicolons at the end of lines. For now, you'll want to include them
> just as we do.

### Syntax

We refer to the exact arrangement of the symbols, characters, and keywords as
**syntax**. These details matter - your computer will only be able to
"understand" proper JavaScript syntax. A programming language is similar to a
spoken language. A spoken language like English has grammar rules that we should
follow in order to be understood by fellow speakers. In the same way, a
programming language like JavaScript has syntax rules that we ought to follow!

As you write your first lines of code in this new language, you may make many
syntax errors. Don't get frustrated! This is normal - all new programmers go
through this phase. Every time we recognize an error in our code, we have an
opportunity to reinforce your understanding of correct syntax. Adopt a growth
mindset and learn from your mistakes.

Additionally, one of the best things about programming is that we can get such
immediate feedback from our creations. There is no penalty for making a mistake
when programming. Write some code, run the code, read the errors, fix the
errors, rinse and repeat!

## Code comments

Occasionally we'll want to leave **comments** or notes in our code. Commented
lines will be ignored by our computer. This means that we can use comments to
write plain english or temporarily avoid execution of some JavaScript lines. The
proper _syntax_ for writing a comment is to begin the line with double forward
slashes (`//`):

```javascript
// let's write another program!!!
console.log("hello world");

// console.log("how are you?");

console.log("goodbye moon");
```

The program above would only print:

```plaintext
hello world
goodbye moon
```

Comments are useful when annotating pieces of code to offer an explanation of
how the code works. We'll want to strive to write straightforward code that is
self-explanatory when possible, but we can also use comments to add additional
clarity. The real art of programming is to write code so elegantly that it is
easy to follow.

"Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability." — Edsger W. Dijkstra

## What you've learned

- `console.log` can be used to print to the screen
- using `//` at the front of a line will turn it into a comment; comments are
  ignored by JavaScript

________________________________________________________________________________
# The Number Type

The **Number** data type in JavaScript does exactly what you expect! It is used
to represent any numerical values, this includes integers and decimal numbers.
As one of our first data types, we'll be interested in what operations we can
use with numbers.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

- predict the evaluation of arithmetic expressions
- explain the order of operations for JavaScript's arithmetic operators
- use the grouping operator, `()`, to manipulate the order of operations in an
  expression

## All the numbers

JavaScript's **Number** encompasses numerical values. All of the following values are of number type:

```javascript
42;
-5;
3.14159;
7.0;
```

## The basic arithmetic operators

For any given data type, we're interested in what operations we can perform with
that type. We use the word _operator_ to refer to the symbol that performs a
particular _operation_. For example, the `+` operator performs the addition
operation. Here are the common arithmetic operators in JS:

- `+` (addition)
- `-` (subtraction)
- `*` (multiplication)
- `/` (division)
- `%` (modulo)

With number values and arithmetic operators in hand, we can evaluate our first
expressions:

```javascript
console.log(2 + 3); // => 5
console.log(42 - 42); // => 0
console.log(-4 * 1.5); // => -6
console.log(25 / 8); // => 3.125
```

Nothing too groundbreaking about the results above. An expression consists of
values and operators. JavaScript will evaluate an expression into a single
value.

We can write more complex expressions using multiple operators. However, we'll
want to be aware of the general math order of operations. That is, we perform
multiplication-division operations first and then addition-subtraction
operations. To force a specific order of operation, we can use the grouping
operator, `( )`, around a part of the expression:

```javascript
console.log(5 * 3 + 2); // => 17
console.log(2 + 3 * 5); // => 17
console.log((2 + 3) * 5); // => 25
```

### The modulo operation

All of the math operators listed above are the simple operations you use
everyday, except for maybe modulo `%`. **Modulo gives us the remainder that
results from a division.** For example, `10 % 3` is 1 because when we divide 10
by 3, we are left with a remainder of 1. We can read `10 % 3` as "ten modulo
three" or "ten mod three."

```javascript
console.log(10 % 3); // => 1
console.log(14 % 5); // => 4
console.log(20 % 17); // => 3
console.log(18 % 6); // => 0
console.log(7 % 9); // => 7
```

Modulo is a very useful operation in the realm of computers. We can use it to
check the divisibility of numbers, whether numbers are even, whether they are
prime, and much, much more. Don't take this seemingly simple operation from
granted!  We'll provide a ton of practice using these modulo patterns as we move through the course.

In the order of operations, modulo has the the same precedence as
multiplication-division. So our complete order of math operations in JS is
parentheses, multiplication-division-modulo, addition-subtraction.

```javascript
// modulo has precedence over addition
console.log(4 + 12 % 5); // => 6
console.log((4 + 12) % 5); // => 1
```

## What you've learned

- The **Number** type is used to represent integer and decimal values
- The operators `+`, `-`, `/`, `*` perform the normal math operations of
  addition, subtraction, division, multiplication respectively
- `a % b` returns the remainder when we divide `a` by `b`; we call this
  operation modulo
- JavaScript follows the usual mathematical order of operations and we can use
  the `()` to force precedence

________________________________________________________________________________
# The String Type

This article is about one of JavaScript's primitive data types, **String**.
Strings are what we'll use to represent textual data. This means that strings
are useful in representing things like messages, names, poems, and so on. A
string is a sequence of characters.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

- Write strings using correct syntax
- Use `.length` to obtain a count of the numbers of characters that comprise a
  string
- Index a string to refer to a single character
- Concatenate strings together

## Writing a valid string

Strings are always wrapped by a pair of single quotation marks (`'`) or by a
pair of double quotation marks (`"`). Between the enclosing quotation marks, we
can put any characters! Here are a six examples of strings:

```javascript
"potato";
"New York";
"azablan@.io";
"Follow the yellow brick road, please!";
"365 days a year";
"";
```

Above, notice that we are free to mix in **any** characters into a string. This
includes spaces, numerics, punctuation, and other symbols. The sixth string
above is the empty string; it contains zero characters!

You are probably wondering why we are allowed to use either single or double
quotes when denoting a string - why is this useful? Maybe we want a string that
_contains_ quotation marks:

```javascript
// valid strings
'Shakespeare wrote, "To be or not to be"';
"That's a great string";
```

```javascript
// invalid string
'That's a bad string'
```

If we want to use a single quote as a character of a string, we simply need to
enclose the string in double quotes, and vice versa.

## Calculating length

Since a single string can contain any number of characters, we may find it
useful to count the number of characters in a string using `.length`:

```javascript
console.log("ramen".length); // => 5
console.log("go home!".length); // => 8
console.log("".length); // => 0
```

## Indexing a string

Strings consist of multiple characters. These characters are numbered by
**indices** starting at 0. So in the string `'bootcamp'`, `'b'` is at index 0,
`'o'` is at index 1, `'o'` is at index 2, `'t'` is at index 3, and so on. We can
look at particular characters of a string by using `[]` and specifying an index:

```javascript
console.log("bootcamp"[0]); // => 'b'
console.log("bootcamp"[1]); // => 'o'
console.log("bootcamp"[2]); // => 'o'
console.log("bootcamp"[3]); // => 't'
console.log("bootcamp"[7]); // => 'p'
console.log("bootcamp"[10]); // => undefined
console.log("bootcamp"[-3]); // => undefined
```

In general, when we index a string using the expression `string[i]`, we get back
the **single character** at position `i`. Looking at the last two examples
above, if we use an invalid index with a string, the value returned is
`undefined`. This makes since because there is no character at the given
position! It's also worth mentioning that an index should always be a number.

### The classic "off by one" error

Bear in mind that indices begin at 0 and not 1! Forgetting this nuance can lead
to incorrect code for both new and experienced programmers alike. Let's hone in
on an important distinction: the index of the last character of a string is
always one less than it's length.

```javascript
console.log("cat".length); // => 3
console.log("cat"[3]); // => undefined
console.log("cat"[2]); // => 't'
```

In other words, although the `length` of `'cat'` is 3, the index of the last
character (`'t'`) is 2.

### Using indexOf

We can also calculate the index of a given character within a string by using
`indexOf`:

```javascript
console.log("bagel".indexOf("b")); // => 0
console.log("bagel".indexOf("a")); // => 1
console.log("bagel".indexOf("l")); // => 4
console.log("bagel".indexOf("z")); // => -1
```

If we attempt to search for a character that is **not** present in a string,
`indexOf` will return -1. This makes sense because we know that -1 is not a
valid string index. The smallest index possible is 0!

If we search for a character that appears more than once in a string,
`indexOf` will return the index of the first occurance of that character.

We can also use `indexOf` to search for a substring of characters. Under this
circumstance, `indexOf` will return the index where the substring begins in the
main string:

```javascript
console.log("door hinge".indexOf("oor")); // => 1
console.log("door hinge".indexOf("hi")); // => 5
console.log("door hinge".indexOf("hint")); // => -1
```

## Concatenation

Concatenation is just a fancy word for joining strings together into a single
string. To concatenate strings, we use the `+` operator:

```javascript
console.log("hello" + "world"); // => 'helloworld'
console.log("goodbye" + " " + "moon"); // => 'goodbye moon'
```

## What you've learned

- a **String** is a data type that contains multiple characters enclosed in
  quotation marks
- `string.length` returns the number of characters in the `string`
- each character of a string is associated with a number index; the first
  character of a string is at index 0
- we can use `string.indexOf(char)` to obtain the index of `char` within
  `string`; if `char` is not found, then -1 is returned
- we can use `+` to concatenate multiple strings, combining them into a single
  string

________________________________________________________________________________
# The Boolean Type

The **Boolean** data type is perhaps the simplest type since there are only two
possible values, `true` and `false`. However, we'll find booleans very useful
because they will act as components of later concepts. As programmers, we'll use
booleans to describe the validity of statements. In an abstract sense, _"Today
is Monday"_ and _"one plus one equals ten"_ are examples of statements with
boolean values. That is, they are either `true` or `false`.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

- predict the evaluation of expressions that use the boolean operations of `!`,
  `||`, and `&&`
- explain DeMorgan's law

## Logical Operators

In the long run, we'll be using booleans to establish logic in our code. For
this reason, the _boolean operators_ can also be referred to as the _logical
operators_. There are only three such operators:

- `!` (not)
- `&&` (and)
- `||` (or)

### Logical NOT

The not (`!`) operator will reverse a boolean value:

```javascript
console.log(!true); // => false
console.log(!false); // => true
console.log(!!false); // => false
```

It's worth mentioning that `!` is a unary operator. This means that the not
operation is applied to a single value. This is in contrast to a binary operator
such as multiplication, which is applied between two values. It does not make
sense to `!` two values together.

### Logical AND

The and (`&&`) operator will take two boolean values and will only evaluate to
`true` when both input values are `true`. Otherwise, it will return `false`:

```javascript
console.log(false && false); // => false
console.log(false && true); // => false
console.log(true && false); // => false
console.log(true && true); // => true
```

### Logical OR

The or (`||`) operator will take two boolean values and will only evaluate to
`false` when both input values are `false`. Otherwise, it will return `true`:

```javascript
console.log(false || false); // => false
console.log(false || true); // => true
console.log(true || false); // => true
console.log(true || true); // => true
```

### Logical order of operations

We can write boolean expressions that consist of multiple logical operations, but we should be aware of the order of operations. JavaScript will evaluate `!` then `&&` then `||`.

```javascript
console.log(true || true && false);    // => true
console.log(false && !(false || true)); // => false
```

In general, `A || B && C` is equivalent to `A || (B && C)` where `A`, `B`, `C` are booleans.

## De Morgan's Law

A common mistake in boolean logic is to incorrectly distribute `!` across parentheses. Say we had boolean values of `A`, `B`. Here is something to remember:

* `!(A || B)` is equivalent to `!A && !B`
* `!(A && B)` is equivalent to `!A || !B`


In other words, to correctly distribute `!` across parentheses, we must also flip the operation within parentheses. Beware that:

* `!(A || B)` is not equivalent to `!A || !B`
* `!(A && B)` is not equivalent to `!A && !B`

We call this property **De Morgan's Law**. Shout out to Augustus De Morgan of Great Britain.

## What you've learned

* `!`, `&&`, `||` are the boolean operators that we can use to establish logic in our code
* De Morgan's Law should be used to distribute `!` against parentheses

These are just the basics of the type. We'll be seeing more booleans in the upcoming section, so stay tuned for that!

________________________________________________________________________________
# Comparison Operators

In our previous introduction to the boolean data type, we described booleans as
way to represent the validity of an expression. We'll continue this conversation
by exploring **comparison** operators. As you learn about these operators, bear
in mind that all comparisons will result in a boolean, `true` or `false`.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

- Predict the result of expressions that utilize the operators `>`, `<`, `>=`
  `<=`, `===`, and `!==`
- Explain the difference between the equality operators `==` and `===`

## The relative comparators

- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- `===` (equal to)
- `!==` (not equal to)

Using these operators is pretty straightforward. Here are a few examples:

```javascript
console.log(10 > 5); // => true
console.log(10 < 5); // => false
console.log(1 < 7); // => true
console.log(7 <= 7); // => true
console.log(5 === 6); // => false
console.log(5 !== 6); // => true
console.log("a" !== "A"); // => true
console.log(false === false); // => true
```

Notice that a comparison expression always evaluate to a boolean value (`true`
or `false`). Comparison operators like `===` are a useful to compare strings,
booleans, etc. not just numbers.

**Did you know?** `'a' < 'b'` is valid JS code? When you relatively compare
strings using `>` or `<` you will be comparing them lexicographically.
Lexicographically is fancy shmancy talk for "dictionary" order! A "lesser"
string is one that would appear earlier in the dictionary:

```javascript
console.log("a" < "b"); // => true
console.log("apple" < "abacus"); // => false
console.log("app" < "apple"); // => true
console.log("zoo" > "mississippi"); // => true
```

**Gotcha** capitilized letters are considered lexicographically less than 
lower case letters.  i.e "A" < "z" // => true.


## === vs ==

In JavaScript there are two equality operators triple-equals (`===`) and
double-equals (`==`). The operators differ in how they compare across differing
types. Triple-equals performs the _strict equality_, meaning it will only return
`true` if the types are the same. Double-equals performs the _loose equality_,
meaning it can return `true` even if the values are of different type.
Double-equals may _coerce_ a value into another type for the comparison, and
this behavior is hard to predict:

```javascript
console.log(5 === "5"); // false
console.log(5 == "5"); // true
console.log(0 === false); // false
console.log(0 == false); //true
```

Whoa! Surprised by these results? It can be hard to predict how `==` behaves, so
we will avoid using it in this course and as a best practice. Stick to using
`===` because it respects data types.

## What you've learned

- `>`, `<`, `>=`,`<=`, `===`, and `!==` can be used to compare values
- we prefer to use `===` to check for equality because it takes the type into
  account.

________________________________________________________________________________
# Basic Variables

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a
computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive
name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by programmers. It is
helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole
purpose is to label and store data in computer memory. This data can then be
used and even changed throughout the lifetime of your program.

When you finish this reading, you should be able to:

- declare variables using the `let` keyword
- assign values to variables using the assignment operator (`=`)
- use the shortcuts `+=`, `-=`, `++`, `--` to reassign variables
- identify `undefined` as the default value for unassigned variables

## Initializing a variable

To initialize a variable in JavaScript we'll need two new pieces of syntax:
`let` and `=`. We can give the variable any name that we wish and assign it a
value. Once we initialize a variable, the variable will evaluate to the value
assigned:

```javascript
let bootcamp = "";
console.log(bootcamp); // ''

let birthYear = 2012;
console.log(birthYear); // 2012
```

**Did you know?** JavaScript variables names can contain any alphanumeric
characters, underscore (\_), or dollar sign (\$). However, they _cannot_ begin
with a number.

Above are examples of how you'll create variables most of the time, so we'll
grow very familiar with the syntax. As a best practice, we should name our
variables in a way that is descriptive and concise.

The variable initializations above really consist of two steps: _declaration_
with `let` and _assignment_ with `=`. Let's break these two steps down.

### Declaring a variable

In JavaScript, in order to use a variable, we must _declare_ it. Variable
**declaration** is the act of introducing the variable to the environment.

To declare a variable, use the `let` keyword, followed by a space and then the
name of the variable.

```javascript
let bootcamp;
console.log(bootcamp); // undefined
```

Once a variable is declared, it will contain `undefined` as it's value.
`undefined` is a common default value in JavaScript, we'll see it come up in a
few different places. You can think of `undefined` as showing that the variable
is empty.

### Assigning a variable

Once a variable has been declared, we can assign it a value using single-equals
`=` :

```javascript
let bootcamp;
console.log(bootcamp); // undefined
bootcamp = "";
console.log(bootcamp); // ''
```

## Manipulating variables

To change the value of a variable, we need to reassign it to a new value with
`=` :

```javascript
let num = 42;
console.log(num + 8); // => 50
console.log(num); // => 42

num = num + 10;
console.log(num); // => 52
```

In the code above, `num + 8` will evaluate to `50`, but it will not change the `num`
variable to `50`. If we want to change the `num` variable, we must reassign to
it.

### Assignment Shorthand

Changing the value of a number variable is something fairly common in the
programming world. Luckily there is some shorthand operators we can use:

```javascript
let number = 0;
number += 10; // equivalent to number = number + 10
number -= 2; // equivalent to number = number - 2
number /= 4; // equivalent to number = number / 4
number *= 7; // equivalent to number = number * 7
console.log(number); // 14
```

We also have other shorthand to add or subtract exactly 1 from a variable, the
increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators:

```javascript
let year = 3004;
year++;
console.log(year); // 3005
year--;
console.log(year); // 3004
```

## NaN

Now that we have the ability to perform arithmetic with variables, let's take a
look at a common programming mistake, getting a result of `NaN` (not a number):

```javascript
let num;
console.log(num + 3); // NaN
```

The above code gives `NaN` because the unassigned `num` variable contains
`undefined`; adding `3` to `undefined` results in `NaN`. In general, any
nonsensical arithmetic will result in `NaN`. Math operations involving
`undefined` is perhaps the most common mistake:

```javascript
console.log(undefined + 3); // NaN
console.log("fish" * 2); // NaN
```

## What you've learned

- variables are declared with `let` and will contain the value `undefined` by
  default
- we can use single-equals `=` to assign variables
- changing a variable requires a reassignment, for which there are many
  shortcuts for (`+=`, `-=`, etc.)

________________________________________________________________________________
# Introduction to Functions

We hope you are ready - because you are on the brink of one of the most fun
parts of writing JavaScript: writing **functions**. A function is a procedure of
code that will run when called. We only "write" a function once (**function
declaration**), but we can "use" it as many times as we please (**function
calls**). Functions are the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript and
mastering them is a big step on the road to JavaScript mastery.

When you finish this reading, you should be able to:

1. Describe what a function in JavaScript is.
2. Demonstrate how to invoke a function.
3. Write a function using function declaration.
4. Use the `return` keyword to return a value from a function.

## Writing Functions

A function is a set procedure of code that will run when called. Functions
really start to make sense when put in the perspective of solving problems. So
for example say you want to find the average of two given numbers. Meaning we
want to take two numbers, add them together then divide by 2:

```js
> (5 + 5) / 2
5

> (15 + 3) / 2
9

> (7 + 2) / 2
4.5
```

Writing out the same code again and again gets tedious fast. What you can do
instead is write a new _function_.

### Function Declaration

A _function definition_ consists of the function keyword, followed by three
things:

1. The **name** of the function.
2. A list of _parameters_ to the function, enclosed in parentheses, `()`.
3. The code to be run when this function is run, enclosed in curly
   brackets,`{ }`.

So for our above example of averaging two numbers we could write a function that
would do that for us! We would write something like the following:

```js
// 1. average is the name of the function
// 2. number1 & number2 are the parameters being passed in
function average(number1, number2) {
  // 3. this is the code run every time this function is used
  return (number1 + number2) / 2;
}
```

First thing to notice for the above `average` function is that we didn't use any
_real_ numbers. You always want to write functions to accept as wide a range of
data as possible. Utilizing the incoming _parameters_ to a function is one of
the keys to making functions flexible.

In the case of the `average` function, we want to use it to calculate the
average of any two numbers. `number1` and `number2` are the _parameters_ for the
`average` function. In other words, the `average` function expects to be given
two numbers, `number1` and `number2`. We'll be talking a lot more about
parameters later - but for now know that when you define a function with
parameters you are declaring those parameters as usable variables within that
function.

The beauty of a function is that if we define it in a clever way, it will work
on a whole slew of data! For example, we want `average` to work on any two
numbers, whether or not they are whole numbers, decimal, negative, etc.

## Invoking or "calling" a function

Now that we've written a function how do we actually use it? Once defined a
function can be invoked or "called" as many times as we please.

### Order of code

Let's step away from `average` for a bit to see how a simple function call
works. Say we run JavaScript code that looks like this:

```js
console.log("First!");

console.log("Second!");
```

Running this code will return exactly as we expect. We will see `First!` printed
out, followed by `Second!`. In other words, JavaScript will evaluate your code
left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Very intuitive! It's exactly how you are
reading these notes right now.

However, when JavaScript sees a function definition, JavaScript will **not**
evaluate the code inside of the definition. It will only "remember" the code so
we can execute it later. The code below only prints `First!` followed by
`Fourth!`:

```js
console.log("First!");

function callMe() {
  console.log("Second!");
  console.log("Third!");
}

console.log("Fourth");

// when run this code is ran it will print out:
// "First!"
// "Fourth"
```

To actually get the code within `callMe` to evaluate, we must _call_ it by using
`callMe()`. The code below will now print out in order:

```js
function callMe() {
  console.log("Second!");
  console.log("Third!");
}

console.log("First!");
// we call the function by adding ending parenthesis
callMe();
console.log("Fourth!");

// when run this code is ran it will print out:
// "First!"
// "Second!"
// "Third!"
// "Fourth"
```

Let's say JavaScript is running the file above. Here are the steps it would
take, starting from the tippy top of the code:

1. JS sees a definition for `callMe`. It will remember this definition in case
   we call the function later. It will **not** evaluate the code inside the
   function yet.
2. JS prints out `First!`
3. JS sees that we are calling `callMe()`. At this point it will look at the
   prior `callMe` definition and run the code inside. It is as if we are
   "jumping" to inside the function definition. This means it will print
   `Second!` followed by `Third!`
4. JS sees there is no more code to be run inside of `callMe`, so it "jumps"
   back to where we originally called `callMe()`
5. JS will continue evaluating in order and print `Fourth!`

### An average example

So a declared function is "saved for later use", and will be executed later,
when it is called, also known as being **invoked**. So thinking back to our
average function we can declare the function and then _invoke_ it.

When we specify what data to use for a function call, we refer to that process
**passing arguments to the function**.

```js
// this is a function definition
function average(number1, number2) {
  return (number1 + number2) / 2;
}

// this is a function call with the arguments being 15 & 3
> average(15, 3)
9

// this is a function call with the arguments being 5 & 5
> average(10, 5)
7.5
```

When we call the function `average(15, 3)`, we run the code inside the
_definition_ for `average`. That is, we plug in the parameters with real numbers
(`number1` becomes `10` and `number2` becomes 16). Think of `number1` and
`number2` as _variables_ that contain the values we pass in when we called the
function. Then we proceed by running the code inside the function. The parameter
names `number1` and `number2` used through the body of the function and behave
like variables.

## Returning a value

Now that we know how functions are declared and invoked let's talk about the
inside of the function. We'll start with a statement: _Every function in
JavaScript returns `undefined` unless otherwise specified._

Now what does that mean? We'll start with a simple example:

```js
function sayNumber(number) {
  console.log(number);
}

> sayNumber(1); // prints 1
1
undefined
```

So what happened there? Let's do a quick step by step:

1. We declared the `sayNumber` function
2. `sayNumber` was called handing in the argument of 1
3. The `number` parameter is printed to the console
4. Then the function ends without encountering a `return` statement. Since
   nothing was specifically returned then the function returned the default
   value for a function which is `undefined`.

Now let's change our above example to use the keyword `return` to return a
value:

```js
function sayNumber(number) {
  console.log(number);
  return true;
}

> sayNumber(1);
1 // sayNumber still prints 1
true // but now sayNumber returns as true
```

Let's go back to our previous `average` function and talk about the `return` we
used there:

```js
function average(number1, number2) {
  return (number1 + number2) / 2;
}

// the function call for average(10, 16) will return 13
// so the result variable will be set to 13
let result = average(10, 16);

// if we want to check what a function returns we can do this:
console.log(result); // prints `13`

// we could alternatively do this:
console.log(average(10, 16));
```

When we _call_ a function, we jump to the function definition and run the code
inside. When we hit a `return` statement, we immediately **exit** the function,
jump back to where we _called_ the function, and evaluate the function call to
the value it _returned_.

**Every function call evaluates to it's return value!** In other words, the
expression `average(10, 16)` evaluates to `13` just like how the expression
`1 + 1` evaluates to `2`.

Another important rule of the return statement is that it stops function
execution immediately. This means that any code after a `return` will not be
executed!

```js
function average(number1, number2) {
  let sum = number1 + number2;
  return sum;
  // anything under the first return will not be executed
  console.log("this will not run")
  return false;
}

 // when the first return is encountered the entire function will return a value
> average(2, 7);
9
```

So the three things to remember about return statements is:

1. Every function call evaluates to it's return value.
2. Every function in JavaScript returns `undefined` unless a `return` is
   specified
3. Once a `return` statement is encountered the function will immediately stop
   and return the value, ignoring any code below the `return` statement.

## The importance of naming

A quick but very important side note about good naming. Take this to heart right
now: **Good names are important**. Do yourself, and every other programmer
reading your code, a favor by always using significant function and variable
names.

For example, `x` is a very non-descriptive name for a variable or function. As
we tackle more complicated problems and our code grows to be more complex, we
are likely to forget what badly named variables originally stood for and what
their purpose was. Non-descriptive names make our code error-prone. **Great code
reads like English and almost explains itself.** As programmers, our goal is to
write code that is not only "correct", but also elegant, readable, and
maintainable! Hold yourself to this high standard.

As far as syntax goes in JavaScript we always name our functions and variables
`camelCase` for multiple words. (Ex: `tipCalculator`, `currentNumber`,
`puppyPartyFinder`). Other languages use other conventions so it's best to pick
up the standard for your chosen language and stick with it.

## What you learned

By writing a function we can reuse code over and over again to solve similar
problems with different input data (arguments). This will make your life easier
and allow you to start working on more complex problems.

This reading covered:

- How to define and invoke a function in JavaScript.
- How to use the `return` keyword to return a value from a function.
- Writing readable JavaScript code by using significant names and following
  `camelCase` conventions for multiple word variables and functions

________________________________________________________________________________
# Parameters and Arguments

When talking about functions one of the first things we mentioned was the word
_parameters_. In this reading we will be covering what exactly a parameter is -
as well as the differentiation between _parameters_ and _arguments_.

When you finish this reading, you should be able to:

1. Identify the difference between parameters and arguments.
2. Write a function that utilizes declared parameters.
3. Invoking a function with passed in arguments.

## The difference between Parameters and Arguments

Let's start off by talking about the difference between _arguments_ and
_parameters_ and how to identify which is which.

1. **Parameters** are comma separated variables specified as part of a
   function's declaration.
2. **Arguments** are values passed to the function when it is invoked.

So by defining _parameters_ when we declare our function we are effectively
setting accessible variables within the function:

```js
function add(firstParameter, secondParameter) {
  console.log(firstParameter + secondParameter);
}

// the add function declares two parameters
> add(1, 2); //=> 3
```

In the above example we declared our parameters when we declared our function.
Now _arguments_ work slightly differently - when the function is invoked we are
passing in _arguments_. So in the above example when we invoked `add(1, 2)` the
`(1,2)` were the _arguments_ being passed in. So when a function is invoked the
value of the declared parameters is assigned to the passed in _arguments_.

You can think of it _parameters_ and _arguments_ like a recipe. A recipe is a
list of ingredients (_parameters_) and list of steps (the code to be run). When
someone cooks the recipe (_invokes_ the function) they add the ingredients they
actually have(_arguments_). The result of cooking the recipe is the delicious
`return` value!

### Extra arguments

In JavaScript a function will not throw an error if the number of _arguments_
passed during a function invocation is different than the number of parameters
listed during function declaration. This is very important to know!

Let's use the above function to demonstrate:

```js
function add(firstParameter, secondParameter) {
  console.log(firstParameter + secondParameter);
}

// this will ignore the 17 & 14
// the first two arguments passed in will be assigned to the first two parameters
> add(1, 2, 17, 14); //=> 3
```

Notice in the above example we passed in 4 arguments (1, 2, 17, 14) to `add`.
Since the function was only looking for two parameters that is all it uses.

### Not enough arguments

Now what happens if we pass in less arguments then needed?

```js
function add(firstParameter, secondParameter) {
  console.log(firstParameter + secondParameter);
}

> add(5); //=> NaN
```

Whoa what happened there? Let's do a play-by-play:

1. `firstParameter` was set to equal the first passed in argument which in the
   above case is 5.
2. Since there is no second argument then `secondParameter` is declared as a
   variable but is set to the default value of `undefined`.
3. The function then tries to add 5 to `undefined` which is definitely not a
   number! So we get `NaN` (which means `Not A Number`) printed to the console.

As you write more functions you'll grow very comfortable using both arguments
and parameters to accomplish your function's goal.

## What you learned

- Parameters are variables defined as a part of a function's declaration.
- Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.
- JavaScript functions can intake a different number of arguments than the
  number of parameters listed during function declaration.

# Control Flow - Conditional Statements

So far the code you've written has been pretty direct in it's intent. You can
define functions and variables but, so far the functions you've created haven't
been able to do that much for you _yet_. It's time to start writing functions
that can do things _conditionally_ by utilizing _control flow_.

In simple terms - **control flow** is the order in which instructions are
executed within a program. One modifies control flow using _control structures_,
expressions that alter the control flow based on given parameters. The control
structures within JavaScript allow the program flow to change within a unit of
code or a function.

This reading will be covering one of the two main _control structures_ you
will use time and time again - _Conditional statements_. _Conditional
statements_ are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

When you finish this reading, you should be able to:

- Write `if`, `else if`, `if...else` conditional statements.
- Know that conditional statements can have only one `if` and one `else`
  statement.
- Identify that conditional statements can be nested.

## A Quick Word on Syntax

Before we get started we'll quickly go over the terms we'll be using to
represent syntax.

1. `[ ]` are square **brackets**
2. `{ }` are curly **braces**
3. `( )` are **parentheses**

## Writing Conditional Statements

Conditional Statements are the second fundamental _control structure_ for
writing JavaScript and are pretty straight forward. The simplest conditional
statement is the `if` statement. An `if` statement has two parts, the _test
expression_ (the code that immediately follows the `if` which goes in
parentheses), and the _then expression_ (this code belongs in braces after the
`if` expression). The _then_ expression will only run when the `if` expression
is truthy.

Here is an example of a simple `if` statement:

```js
// this is the test expression
if (3 === 3) {
  // this is the then expression
  // this code will run if the above statement is true
  console.log("this is a three!");
}
```

The `if` statement above allows you to specify what should happen if your
particular expression evaluates to true. You can chain additional _test
expressions_ onto this `if` statement by using a `else if` statement.

The syntax for `else if` is very similar as an `if` statement:

```js
function mathFun() {
  let x = 2 + 3;

  if (x === 3) {
    console.log("we have a 3");
  } else if (x === 4) {
    // this code will run if the above statement is true
    console.log("we have a 4");
  } else if (x === 5) {
    // this code will run if the above statement is true
    console.log("we have a 5");
  }
};

mathFun(); // => "we have a 5"
```

The `else if` and `if` statements do not, however, provide the option to specify
something else that should happen in the event that all of the above expressions
evaluate to be `falsey`. The `if...else` statement reads just like English. The
JS interpreter will execute the `else` statement if all the above conditions
given are `falsey`. See below for an example:

```js
function mathFun() {
  let x = 19;
  if (x === 3) {
    console.log("we have a 3");
  } else if (x === 4) {
    console.log("we have a 4");
  } else {
    console.log("I will return if everything above me is falsey!");
  }
};

mathFun(); // => "I will return if everything above me is falsey!"
```

You can chain an arbitrary number of `else if` statements but there can only be
one `if` statement and one optional `else` statement. The `if` introduces the control
structure and the `else` acts as a fail safe to catch everything that didn't
meet the above conditions.

Only one _then expression_ is ever executed in an `if`, `if...else`, or
`if...else` statement. If one of the _test expressions_ is truthy, then the
result of its _then expression_ is the result of the **entire** conditional
statement:

```js
let x = 3;
if (x === 3) {
  console.log("this will run");
} else {
  console.log("this will not run");
}
```

Additionally, you can nest conditional statements within each other but it will
get hard to read pretty quickly and is discouraged:

```js
function mathFun(x) {
  if (x === "math") {
    if (x === "math" && x[0] === "m") {
      if (x[1] === "a") {
        console.log("this got confusing fast");
      } else {
        console.log("that is not math!");
      }
    } else {
      console.log("that is for sure not math!");
    }
  } else {
    console.log("I will return if everything above me is false!");
  }
};

mathFun("math"); // => "this got confusing fast"
```

## What You Learned

- Conditional statements allow us to control what actions should be taken based
  on a boolean (truthy or falsey) expression
- In a chain of _then expressions_ (`if...else if...else`), only one of the
  _then expressions_ will be executed.
- Conditional statements can have only one `if` and one `else` statement.
- Conditional statements can be nested.

________________________________________________________________________________
# Mutually Exclusive Conditions

You have now learned how to write conditional statements. Now we'll talk a
little bit more about how to write them using best practices.

When you finish this reading, you should be able to:

- Identify a pair of mutually exclusive conditions.

## When to use if statements

Say you are given the challenge to write a function that that will call another
function named `bigNumber` if the given argument is **greater** than 100 or call
a function named `smallNumber` if it the given argument is smaller. You could
write a function to do that which would look like this:

```js
function numberSeparator(number) {
  if (number < 100) {
    // number is smaller than 100 so we invoke smallNumber
    smallNumber();
  }
  if (number === 100) {
    // number is equal to 100 so we invoke smallNumber
    smallNumber();
  }
  if (number > 100) {
    // number is larger than 100 so we invoke bigNumber
    bigNumber();
  }
}
```

As you can probably tell the above function uses a lot of code to do a simple
task. To be clear the function above would work for our aim - but it repeats
itself. There is an age old principal for writing good code named **DRY** or
**Don't repeat yourself**. As good programmers we always want our code to be
clear, concise, and efficient.

A general rule of thumb is that if you are working with a condition that is
**mutually exclusive**, meaning if one condition is true the other condition
must be false, then you should use an `if/else` statement. You can also think of
**mutually exclusivity** like a coin flip - it can be either heads or tails but
not both.

Going back to the original problem at hand we can see it makes intuitive sense
with the way the challenge is phrased: If the number is larger than 100 then
we'll call `bigNumber`, otherwise we invoke is `smallNumber`.

So let's rewrite the above function to read a little more clearly:

```js
function numberSeparator(number) {
  if (number > 100) {
    bigNumber();
  } else {
    smallNumber();
  }
}

// this also works
function numberSeparator(number) {
  if (number <= 100) {
    smallNumber();
  } else {
    bigNumber();
  }
}
```

Look at how much clearer that is! Writing good code is an art - devote yourself
to becoming an artist!

## What you Learned

- How to identify a pair of mutually exclusive conditions.
- DRY - don't repeat yourself!

# Control Flow - Looping

A quick reminder before we start - **control flow** is the order in which
instructions are executed within a program. One modifies control flow using
_control structures_, expressions that alter the control flow based on given
parameters. This reading will be covering the second of the main _control
structures_ you will use time and time again - _loops_.

When you finish this reading, you should be able to:

1. Know how to write a `while` loop and a `for` loop.
   - Know how to convert a `for` loop into a `while` loop
2. Know that index variables conventionally start at zero.
3. Explain what an _iteration_ is.

## Looping

Imagine you are at a friend's house and your friend has six dogs. Someone left
the back gate open and all the dogs go out in the yard and get super muddy. Now
your friend wants to clean their dogs but they only have one bathtub! You can't
wash all the dogs at once. So the only option is to give the dogs a bath one at
a time until they are all clean. When you start 0 dogs are clean and 6 dogs are
dirty.

_While_ there are still dirty dogs you still have a job to do. That is your
**condition** - you will stop giving baths once all 6 dogs are clean. So after
one bath you you have 1 clean dog and 5 dirty dogs. You've
_incremented_(increased by one) your number of clean dogs. After each bath you
check your **condition** again until you have 6 clean dogs so you know you can
stop!

What we've described above is the idea of looping - setting a condition,
executing an action, doing something to make sure our condition will be met
eventually, and rechecking our condition before executing our next action.

Loops are a fundamental _control structure_ for writing JavaScript.
Loops will repeatedly execute a section of code while a condition is true. Loops
are simple to write and incredibly powerful! There are many variations of loop
but we will be covering the two most fundamental loops now - **while** loops and
**for** loops.

### While Loops

One of the simplest loops in `JavaScript` is the `while` loop. As with all
loops, the `while` loop will execute a block of code as long as a specified
condition is true. The while loop starts with the keyword `while` then states a
condition in parentheses. The code in the following braces will be run until the
above condition is met.

```js
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

In the following example, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as
long as a variable (`index`) is less than 10:

```js
let index = 0;

// this is the condition that will be checked every time this loop is run
while (index < 10) {
  console.log("The number is " + index);
  // this is common shorthand for index = index + 1
  index++;
}
```

The most important thing to remember when writing any loop is to always be
working towards your condition. In the example above if we did not increment the
`index` variable by 1 each time the loop ran then we would be stuck with what we
call an **infinite loop**:

```js
let index = 0;

// this is an infinite loop because our condition will never be met
while (index < 10) {
  console.log("The number is " + index);
  // if we do not increase the index then our condition is never met
  // Meaning this will run forever!
}
```

The above code will run until whatever interpreter you are using crashes.

### Important Loop Knowledge

A quick word before we learn about the next loop.

The _index_ is the traditional word for the variable that keeps track of how
many times the loop has been run. Don't write loops with indices starting at
one; you'll confuse other programmers and yourself. Indices have started at zero
for a long time, and for good reason. It's much easier to use loops that start
with an index of zero because Array and String indices also start at zero.

```js
let array = [0, 1, 2];
let index = 0;

while (index < array.length) {
  console.log(
    "Both the index and the current array position are " + array[index]
  );
  index++;
}
```

In the above code we will do one loop for each digit in the Array above. We call
each of those loops an "iteration". An iteration is the act of repeating a
procedure, hence looping is an **iterative** technique. Each repetition itself
is also called an "iteration." So you can use loops to _iterate_ through Arrays
and Strings.

### For Loops

A `for` loop can be broken down into three sections:

1. The _initial expression_ which will be run once at the beginning of the loop.
2. The _condition_ which is checked every time the loop is run. If this
   condition is true the loop will run again. If this condition is false the
   loop will end.
3. The _loopEnd expression_ which will be run at the end of the loop before
   checking the _condition_ again.

```js
for (<initial expression>;<condition>;<loopEnd expression>)
```

The `for` loop is usually used with an integer counter:

```js
for (let index = 0; index < 10; index += 1) {
  // the code inside this block will run 10 times
}
```

While the _loopEnd expression_ is normally used to increase a variable by one
per loop iteration, it can contain any statement, such as one that decreasing
the counter, or increasing it by 2.

You can use the `for` loop to iterate through all kinds of things. Check out the
example below for how to iterate through a String:

```js
let testString = "testing";

// we can use the testString's length as our condition!
// Since we know the testString's index starts at 0
// and our index starts at 0 we can access each letter:
for (let index = 0; index < testString.length; index += 1) {
  let letter = testString[index];
  console.log(letter);
}
```

These are the most basic types of loops. If all else fails, you can always fall
back on these two loops. All the other loop forms are just more convenient forms
of these basic loop styles.

## Translating From One Loop to Another

So far we have covered both `while` and `for` loops. Once you understand the
concept of looping it's easy to translate one loop to another:

```js
// these two do the exact same thing!
function forLoopDoubler (array) {
  // it is convention to shorten index to just i in most cases
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    array[i] = array[i] * 2;
  }
  return array;
};

function forLoopDoubler (array) {
  let i = 0;
  while (i < array.length) {
    array[i] = array[i] * 2;
    i++;
  }
  return array;
};

forLoopDoubler([1, 2, 3]); // => [2,4,6]
whileLoopDoubler([1, 2, 3]); //=> [2,4,6]
```

## What You Learned

- We can use a `for` or `while` loop to repeat a block of code repeatedly.
- While the loop condition is true, we will execute another iteration of the
  loop.
- When the loop condition is false, we will exit the loop.

# The Array Type

This reading will be about one of JavaScript's global objects, the **Array**
type. JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values all within a single
structure, much like a creating a list. Arrays can hold strings, integers and
even other arrays! Arrays are incredibly useful for holding a bunch of different
information all in one place.

When you finish this reading, you should be able to:

- Write arrays using correct syntax
- Identify that an array is an ordered list of values defined by using brackets
- Use `.length` to obtain a count of the numbers of elements that comprise an
  array
- Index an array to refer to a single value
- Concatenate multiple arrays together

## Using arrays

While coding you will find that you often find yourself needing to refer to a
bunch of data at once. For instance, what if you wanted to refer to the entire
English alphabet. Sure, you could create a bunch variables for each letter in
the alphabet:

```js
let a = "a";
let b = "b";
let c = "c";
let d = "d";
// and so on for way too long...
```

However this becomes cumbersome and unmanageable quickly. An Array is a data
structure that solves this problem. Arrays are always wrapped in square
brackets, `[]`, and store their comma separated values in sequential order.
Arrays in JavaScript are also very flexible: we can put elements into an array,
replace elements in an array, and remove elements from the array.

So going back to our first example of containing the alphabet:

```js
let alphabet = [
  "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f",
  "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l",
  "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r",
  "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x",
  "y", "z"
];
```

## Indexing arrays

### Calculating the length of an array

Since an array can container any number of values you will find it useful to
count the number of values available to you using `.length`:

```js
console.log([4, 7, 9].length); // => 3
console.log([1, 2].length); // => 2
console.log([].length); // => 0
```

### Properly indexing an array

Arrays consist of multiple values all stored in sequential order. These value
are numbered by **indices** starting at 0 (just like indexing a string!). So
given the below example:

```js
let numbersAndLetters = ["b", "z", 17, "cat"];
```

In the above `numbersAndLetters` array if we access `numbersAndLetters` at the
index of 0 we get back the value of "b". If we access `numbersAndLetters` at the
index of 1 we get "z", at the index of 3 we get 17, etc. We can specify which
value we'd like to access in an array by using square brackets,`[]`, and
specifying an index:

```js
console.log(numbersAndLetters[0]); // => "b"
console.log(numbersAndLetters[1]); // => "z"
console.log(numbersAndLetters[2]); // => 17
console.log(numbersAndLetters[3]); // => "cat"
```

Notice that even though the index at `numbersAndLetters[3]` has the value of a
string with multiple characters ("cat") we return the _entire value_ listed at
that index.

**Reminder:** Arrays **always** start at the index of 0, not 1. This is the
convention in programming. Additionally, indices should always be a number.

We can access a value in an array directly by providing an index for the value
we'd like to access in that array (`array[index]`). See below for an example:

```js
console.log(["a", "b", "c"][0]); // => "a"
console.log(["a", "b", "c"][1]); // => "b"
console.log(["a", "b", "c"][2]); // => "c"
console.log(["a", "b", "c"][3]); // => `undefined`
```

As we see in the code above, if we try to access an element at an index that is
not inside the array, we get back `undefined`. This makes sense because there is
no value at that given position!

### The classic "off by one" error

Arrays are similar to strings in that both of their indices start at 0 instead
of 1. Forgetting this fact can lead to some pretty confusing situations. Let's
focus on an important distinction: the index of the last value of an array is
always one less than its length.

```javascript
console.log([4, 7, 9].length); // => 3
console.log([4, 7, 9][3]); // => undefined
console.log([4, 7, 9][2]); // => 9
```

In other words, although the `length` of `[4, 7, 9]` is 3, the index of the last
value (`9`) is 2. A good rule of thumb of accessing the last index of an array
is to find the length and then subtract one:

```js
let testArray = [4, 7, 9];
let finalIndex = testArray.length - 1; // => (3 - 1) = 2
console.log(testArray[finalIndex]); // => 9
```

## Working with arrays

### Containing data in arrays

By packaging groups of related data into a single array, we gain the added
benefit of being able to refer to that data as a single collection. Arrays don't
have to just hold single characters- they are capable of holding entire strings,
numbers, and even other arrays!

```js
let wackyArray = [2, 17, "apple", "cat", ["apple"]];

console.log(wackyArray[0]); // => 2
console.log(wackyArray[1]); // => 17
console.log(wackyArray[3]); // => "cat"
console.log(wackyArray[4]); // => ["apple"]
```

Just think of all the possibilities of what you can store in a single array!
However, just because you can _doesn't_ mean you should. In practice we will
almost always be storing similar kinds of data, that are coming from a common
source (i.e. items in a shopping list, ID numbers, tasks on a todo list).

### Using indexOf with arrays

We can also calculate the index of a given value within an array by using
`indexOf`:

```javascript
console.log([1, 3, 5, "apple", "jet"].indexOf(3)); // => 1
console.log([1, 3, 5, "apple", "jet"].indexOf(5)); // => 2
console.log([1, 3, 5, "apple", "jet"].indexOf("jet")); // => 4

// this won't be found in the array
console.log([1, 3, 5, "apple", "jet"].indexOf("potato")); // => -1
```

If we attempt to search for a value that is **not** present in an array,
`indexOf` will return -1. This makes sense because we know that -1 is not a
valid array index. The smallest index possible is 0!

## Concatenation with arrays

As a reminder, concatenation is just a fancy word for joining things together
into a single collection. Now, this is where arrays will differ from strings.
The `+` operator only exists for numbers and strings. If you try to use the `+`
on an array it will try to help you out by _converting your arrays into
strings_.

```js
console.log([1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]); // => 1,2,34,5,6
```

JavaScript was just trying to help! However that is probably not what you meant
to do. Good thing JavaScript has a seperate method for putting two array
together. To concatenate arrays, we can use the aptly named `.concat` method:

```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6])); // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## What you've learned

- An **Array** is a data type that contains a list of in order values surrounded
  in square brackets `[]`.
- `array.length` returns the number of values in the `array`.
- Each value of an array is associated with a number index; the first value of
  an array is at the index of 0.
- We can use `array.indexOf(value)` to obtain the index of `value` within
  `array`; if `value` is not found, then -1 is returned.
- We can use `.concat` to concatenate multiple arrays, combining them into a
  single array.

# Function Expressions

You may have noticed that we've been writing many functions so far in the
course! We will continue to do so since functions are the building blocks of the
eventual applications that we will build. That being said, let's begin to
broaden the way we think about functions. In particular, we'll want think of
functions as expressions that we can store in variables - just like our classic
data types of number, string, boolean, array, and object!

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

- identify functions as first-class objects in JavaScript
- define a function using function expression syntax

## Functions as first-class objects

JavaScript is well known for being a programming language that treats functions
as "first-class objects". This fancy talk means that you can treat a function as
a "normal" value by storing it in a variable. We'll leverage this key concept in
very clever ways later in the course. For now, let's begin with a simple example
that shows the "first-class object" nature of functions:

```javascript
let calculateAverage = function(a, b) {
  return (a + b) / 2;
};

console.log(calculateAverage(10, 20)); // 15
```

In the code snippet above, we define the `calculateAverage` by assigning a
variable to contain the function's definition. By doing this, the variable's
name is effectively the function's name. So to call the function, we simply
refer to the variable name. Note that we do not write the function's name after
the `function` keyword, where we normally would. We will refer to this new way
of defining functions as _function expression syntax_ and the classic way of
defining functions as _function declaration syntax_. In general, we can define
functions using either syntax:

```javascript
// function declaration syntax
function myFunctionName(arg1, arg2) {}

// function expression syntax
let myFunctionName = function(arg1, arg2) {};
```

In the coming sections, we'll highlight moments when we'll prefer one syntax
over the other. For now, get acquainted with the new syntax as it is something
you'll be seeing a lot of as a programmer!

### A peek under the hood

Perhaps you're finding it tough to understand what it means for a variable to
contain a function - it is indeed a very abstract idea for new programmers.
Let's draw a comparison. We know that when we assign an expression to variable,
the expression first evaluates to a single value, which we then store in the
variable name:

```javascript
let myNum = 4 + 4;
console.log(myNum); // prints 8
console.log(myNum * 3); // prints 24
```

In the same way we can treat a function definition as an expression that
evaluates!

```javascript
let myFunc = function() {
  console.log("I'm a function");
};

console.log(myFunc); // prints [Function: myFunc]
myFunc(); // prints "I'm a function"
```

Looking at the snippet immediately above, you'll notice that when we print the
`myFunc` variable directly, without calling the function with parentheses,
JavaScript simply says the variable contains a function named myFunc
(`[Function: myFunc]`). You can truly imagine a function as a value that we can
store and use as we please.

> The term _anonymous function_ may also be used to describe a function
> expression before it is assigned to any variable. Following the example above,
> we'll use the word _anonymous function_ to describe the function expression
> _before_ the assignment to the `myFunc` variable is complete. Once the
> assignment is complete, it would be silly to refer to `myFunc` as an
> `anonymous function` because an _anonymous function_ has no name.

## What you've learned

- functions can be stored in variables; just like any other values in
  JavaScript!

________________________________________________________________________________
# Two-Dimensional Arrays (2D Arrays)

Time to broaden our understanding of arrays! We've already explore the
fundamentals of arrays. Mainly, we can store any type of data we please as
elements of an array and even mix types together. However, what happens if we
store an array as an element of an array?

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

- index into the inner elements of a 2D array
- use nested loops to iterate through a 2D array

## Multidimensional Arrays

When we store arrays as elements of other arrays, we refer to those structures
as multidimensional arrays. If the "depth" of the nested arrays is at exactly 2 (an
outer array containing inner arrays), then we'll refer to it as a
two-dimensional array:

```javascript
let twoDimensional = [["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e"], ["f", "g", "h"]];

console.log(twoDimensional[1]); // [ 'd', 'e' ]
console.log(twoDimensional[1][0]); // 'd'

let subArr = twoDimensional[1];
console.log(subArr[0]); // 'd'
```

Note that indexing the outer `twoDimensional` array will return an element like
usual, it's just that element happens to be another array. To gain access to the
innermost elements, we simply need to apply another set of indexing brackets!

If we style our 2D arrays nicely so that each subarray is on a new line, we can
interpret the double indices as `[row][column]`:

```javascript
let twoDimensional = [
	["a", "b", "c"],
	["d", "e"],
	["f", "g", "h"]];

// get the element in the 0th row, 2nd col:
console.log(twoDimensional[0][2]); // 'c'
```

## Iterating through 2D Arrays

Since a 2D array is just an array of arrays. We'll need to use a loop within a
loop to iterate through a 2D array:

```javascript
let array = [["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e"], ["f", "g", "h"]];

for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  let subArray = array[i];
  console.log(subArray);

  for (let j = 0; j < subArray.length; j++) {
    console.log(subArray[j]);
  }
}
```

In the nested loops above, the `i` index refers to the current "row" and the `j`
index refers to the current "column". It's worth noting that since the inner
subArrays have different length, we'll want to specifically reference the length
of that subarray in our inner loop condition `j < subArray.length`. The code
above will print:

```plaintext
[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
a
b
c
[ 'd', 'e' ]
d
e
[ 'f', 'g', 'h' ]
f
g
h
```

## When is a 2D array practical?

As a preview of things to come let's briefly mention when you'll find a 2D array
useful in your future projects. Imagine how'd you represent a "grid":

- tic-tac-toe (3x3 grid)
- chess (8x8 grid)
- sudoku (9x9 grid)
- excel (a sheet is an arbitrarily sized 2D array)

## What you've learned

- an array can contain arrays as elements, we call this a 2D arrays
- to iterate through a 2D array, used nested loops

# Mutability in JavaScript

So far in the course we've explored a handful of methods that manipulate data.
We'll be growing our arsenal of methods further overtime, so we'll want to gain
awareness for **exactly** how we should expect these methods to manipulate the
data we give them. To this end, let's analyze which methods will modify existing
data and which methods do not. We refer to this concept as **mutability**.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

- Explain what "mutability" is
- Correctly label JavaScript data types as immutable or mutable

## What is mutability?

At its face value, _mutability_ is a simple concept. You may be familiar with
the word _mutation_, which refers to a alteration (usually in DNA). Something
that is _mutable_ can be changed, while something that is _immutable_ is
unchanging and permanent. To illustrate this concept, we'll begin with strings
and arrays. We've spent some time with these two data types and by now we
recognize that the two types share many similarities. Both have indices,
`length`, and even share common methods like `slice`. However, they differ
greatly in their mutability:

```javascript
let myArr = ["b", "e", "a", "m"];
myArr[0] = "s";
console.log(myArr); // 'seam'

let myStr = "beam";
myStr[0] = "s";
console.log(myStr); // 'beam'
```

Above we have shown that we can assign a new element to an index of an array,
but we cannot assign a new character to an index of a string. In other words,
arrays are _mutable_, but strings are _immutable_.

An implication of this discovery is that there are _some_ array methods that
will modify an existing array but _zero_ methods that will modify an existing
string. Methods that manipulate string data typically return a _new_ string and
never modify an existing one. A prime example is `toUpperCase`:

```javascript
let word = "piñata";
let newWord = word.toUpperCase();
console.log(word); // 'piñata'
console.log(newWord); // 'PIÑATA'
```

Above, notice that the `toUpperCase` method returns a capitalized version of the
string, but does not change the original string. It's also worth noting that not
every array method will mutate. For example, the `slice` method does not mutate
for both strings and arrays. As we learn about methods in the future, we'll be
certain to note what mutates and what does not.

## Mutable or immutable, that is the question

Now that we have a grasp of _mutability_, let's take inventory and identify
JavaScript's data types as mutable or immutable.

**Mutable**

- array
- object (we'll learn these soon)

**Immutable**

- number
- string
- boolean

A quick way to remember the above list is to identify that the composite types
(the types that can contain multiple values) of array and object are mutable.
The remaining "simpler" types of number, string, and boolean are immutable.

## The mutability misconception

Maybe you are having a tough time believing what we have just claimed. We don't
blame you, you've probably heard the saying that change is the only constant in
the universe. Let's debunk a common argument to turn you into a believer. The
skeptical programmer may use this as an argument to show that numbers are
mutable:

```javascript
let myNum = 42;
myNum += 8;
console.log(myNum); // 50
```

Because the `myNum` variable now contains `50` where it once contained `42`, it
may seem we have mutated the number, but this is not truly the case. Recall that
`myNum += 8` is shorthand for `myNum = myNum + 8`. Since the right hand side of
the assignment evaluates first, we are simply taking the new number of `50` and
reassigning it to the `myNum` variable. This reassignment of a variable name is
not a mutation of the original number.

## What you've learned

- data types that can be changed are mutable, those that cannot be changed are
  immutable
- arrays and objects are mutable
- numbers, strings, and booleans are immutable

# Array Splice

Time to a learn yet another array method! The [Array#splice][mdn-splice] method
deserves its own reading because of how versatile it is. Feel free to use this
article as a quick reference; let's jump right in.

When you finish reading this article, you should be able to:

- list all possible arguments that can be used with the `Array#splice` method

## Notation

For clarity in this article and moving forward in the course, we'll be notating
methods with `#` to clarify how they should be called. For example,
`Array#splice` refers to the method that should be called on an array,
`arr.splice()` where `arr` is some array variable. Likewise `String#toUpperCase`
refers to the method that should be called on a string, `str.toUpperCase()`
where `str` is some string variable. We'll opt to refer to methods using this
notation because some methods can be called on multiple data types, such as
`Array#slice` and `String#slice`.

## What can Array#splice do?

Before we explore the nitty-gritty details of the `Array#splice` method, the
first thing to be aware of is that the method will **mutate** the array that it
is called on. That is, `Array#splice` will modify the existing array and _not_
return a new array.

### Using splice to remove

The usage of the `Array#splice` method is easy to mix up because it can be used
to remove or insert elements into an array. That's right - it can perform
"opposite" operations, even at the same time! For now, we'll begin by _only_
removing elements from an array:

```javascript
let colors = ["red", "yellow", "blue", "green", "orange", "brown", "gray"];
let returnVal = colors.splice(2, 3);
console.log(colors); // [ 'red', 'yellow', 'brown', 'gray' ]
console.log(returnVal); // [ 'blue', 'green', 'orange' ]
```

The first two arguments for splice correspond to 1) the target index and 2) how
many elements to remove. The call `colors.splice(2, 3)`, will remove the next
three elements beginning at index 2. This means that the elements at indices 2,
3, and 4 are removed.

Note that splice returns an array containing the elements that were removed and
also has the effect of removing the elements from the _original_ array, mutating
it in-place.

### Using splice to insert

To use the splice method to insert new elements into an array, we can pass in
any number of additional arguments representing the values to insert:

```javascript
let colors = ["red", "yellow", "blue"];
let returnVal = colors.splice(1, 0, "RebeccaPurple", "CornflowerBlue");
console.log(colors); // [ 'red', 'RebeccaPurple', 'CornflowerBlue', 'yellow', 'blue' ]
console.log(returnVal); // []
```

The method call `colors.splice(1, 0, 'RebeccaPurple', 'CornflowerBlue')`
translates to "target index 1, remove the next 0 elements, then insert
`'RebeccaPurple'` and `'CornflowerBlue'`."

### Using splice like a pro

Naturally, we can combine these two functionalities! Say we wanted to target
index 2, remove the next 3 elements, then insert `'Gainsboro'`, `'Ivory'`, and
`'Khaki'`:

```javascript
let colors = ["red", "yellow", "blue", "green", "black", "beige"];
let removed = colors.splice(2, 3, "Gainsboro", "Ivory", "Khaki");
console.log(colors); // [ 'red', 'yellow', 'Gainsboro', 'Ivory', 'Khaki', 'beige' ]
console.log(removed); // [ 'blue', 'green', 'black' ]
```

Bam. What a versatile method! Always feel free to reference the
[documentation][mdn-splice] for the method when you are struggling to remember
its usage:

## What you've learned

- Array#splice has two required arguments
  - the target index
  - the number of elements to remove beginning at that target index
- Array#splice can also take in any number of values to be inserted at the
  target index

# String#split and Array#join

We've seen previously that strings and arrays share many similar properties. For
example, strings and arrays both have a `length` and can have multiple indices.
Because of this, you may find it useful to "convert" between the two types.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

- use the `String#split` method to turn a string into an array
- use the `Array#join` method to turn an array into a string

## String#split

The [String#split][string-split-mdn] method is called on a string and accepts a
"separator" string as an argument. The method will return an array where the
elements are the resulting substrings when we cut at the "separators":

```javascript
let sentence = "follow the yellow brick road";
let words = sentence.split(" ");
console.log(words); // [ 'follow', 'the', 'yellow', 'brick', 'road' ]
console.log(sentence); // 'follow the yellow brick road'
```

Note that the original string is _not mutated_, rather a new array is returned.
A common pattern is to split a sentence string on a space (' '), but you can
split on any separator as you see fit:

```javascript
let sentence = "follow the yellow brick road";
console.log(sentence.split(" ")); // [ 'follow', 'the', 'yellow', 'brick', 'road' ]
console.log(sentence.split("the")); // [ 'follow ', ' yellow brick road' ]
console.log(sentence.split("o")); // [ 'f', 'll', 'w the yell', 'w brick r', 'ad' ]
```

A pattern you may find useful is that when you split on a separator string, it
is guaranteed that that separator will not be in the resulting array,
effectively removing it. See the example of `sentence.split('the')` above. This
may come in handy, so keep it in mind!

## Array#join

The [Array#join][array-join-mdn] method is called on an array and accepts a
"separator" string as an argument. The method will return a string where
elements of the array are concatenated together with the "separator" between
each element:

```javascript
let words = ["run", "around", "the", "block"];
let sentence = words.join(" ");
console.log(sentence); // 'run around the block'
console.log(words); // [ 'run', 'around', 'the', 'block' ]

console.log(words.join("_")); // 'run_around_the_block'
console.log(words.join("HI")); // 'runHIaroundHItheHIblock'
```

`Array#join` does not mutate the original array, instead it will return a new
string.

## A clever combination

It's pretty evident that `String#split` and `Array#join` are "opposite" methods.
That is:

- we use split to turn a string into a array
- we use join to turn an array into a string

By combining these two methods we can accomplish some cool behavior:

```javascript
let str = "I don't know what I want to eat";
let newStr = str.split("I").join("we");
console.log(newStr); // 'we don't know what we want to eat'
```

Whoa! We were able to replace every substring "I" with the substring "we". We
know that the line `str.split('I').join('we')` evaluates from left to right.
This means that the `split` will cut the string wherever there is an 'I',
leaving a gap where the 'I's were. Then, the `join` will fill those gaps with
'we's.

## What you've learned

- we can use `String#split` and `Array#join` to convert between strings and
  arrays
- both methods do not mutate their input

# Determining Types

Sometimes you want to know the type of value store in a variable so that you can
safely do things with it. If your function expects an array in its parameter but
gets a number, you can't call the `map` method on that!

In this article you will learn how to figure out if a value in a variable is

* A string
* A number
* A function
* An array

## The typeof operator

Not all operators in JavaScript require two arguments like the `+` operator for
addition, the `=` for assignment, and the `%` operator for modulo division.
Those are all called _binary_ operators because they take two (bi-) operands,
or things that are operated on.

JavaScript kindly gives you the operator `typeof` which acts on a single value.
Operators that take only one operand are called _unary_ operators because "u
only give them one value!" (That's a joke. "uni-" or "una-" is one.)

Here are some examples of what you'd expect to see with the `typeof` operator.

```js
let s = 'This is a string';
console.log(typeof s);    // 'string'

let n = 6.28;
console.log(typeof n);    // 'number'

let sum = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(typeof sum);  // 'function'
```

Note that the value returned from the `typeof` operator is a String data type.
So, if you want to check if a value is a number, you could do this.

```js
if (typeof n === 'number') {
  // It is a number. Do some maths!
} else {
  console.log('I really wanted a number. :-(');
}
```

## How to tell if a value is an array

Unfortunately, due to a _really old bug_ in the way that JavaScript works, a bug
that no one can fix because people wrote code that relies on the bug for
decades, you cannot use the `typeof` operator to figure out if something is an
array.

```js
let a = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(typeof a);  // 'object'
```

Gee, JavaScript. That's not helpful. Thanks.

Luckily, it only took 12 years for JavaScript to include a way to test if a
value is an array. To do so, you use the `Array.isArray` method like this.

```js
let a = [1, 2, 3];
Array.isArray(a);  // true

let n = 6.28;
Array.isArray(n);  // false

let f = function () {}
Array.isArray(f);  // false
```

## Practical use in "real" code

Oddly enough, you won't see a lot of code in real-world applications testing if
a value is one type or another. A lot of JavaScript functions just _assume_ that
they will get arguments of the right kind because the parameter names imply what
kind of value to pass in. For example, the following function has a parameter
named `sentence`.

```js
function reverseTheSentence(sentence) {
  // ... code here ...
}
```

Most developers will know that the function probably wants `sentence` to be a
string value. They just won't pass in an array or number or ... well, anything
other than a string. Because that's just not polite. They'd expect any other
kind of value to cause the `reverseTheSentence` to malfunction. Only when you
know that people that don't respect your code will use it should you add in some
kind of check like this.

```js
function reverseTheSentence(sentence) {
  if (typeof sentence !== 'string') {
    // Tell the developer they are using
    // the function wrong.
  }
  // ... code here ...
}
```

## What you've seen

This article has shown you two ways to determine if a value is a kind of type:

* the `typeof` operator to use to test if a value is a number, a string, or
  a function; and,
* the `Array.isArray` method to check if a value is an array.

Use them as much (or as little) as you need!

# The Null Type (And Undefined)

You've met numbers and string, Booleans and arrays. There's another type often
used in JavaScript: the Null type. And, it's a special type.

In this article, you will learn about the Null type, its value, and how to work
with it in JavaScript.

## A type with only one value

You have seen that the String type can have an "infinite" number of values
(within the limits of your computer memory). For example, the String type
represents _any_ of the following values.

```js
// Examples of values with the String type
'hello, world'
"this is a string"
`Where is my pudding?`
''
'A really long string.........................................................'
```

The Number type also has this aspect. Any number that you can reasonable express
in JavaScript has the Number type.

```js
// Examples of values with the Number type
-100
99
6.28
Infinity
```

You also know about the Boolean type. It can have only two values.

```js
// The only two values of Boolean type
true
false
```

There are not _more_ Boolean values. You can't dream up more. There are only
two, those two.

The Null type has one and exactly one value.

```js
// The only value that has the Null type
null
```

It's just that word: `null`. No quotation marks. No other fancy things. Just
`null`.

## The meaning of null

This is a harder subject to tackle because it's a _philosophical_ subject. Many
people ask, "What does the value of `null` mean in a program?" There are a
couple of answers that programmers give to this. None of them are wrong. None of
them are right. They just are. In the presence of `null`, the code you write
determines which of the following meanings `null` has.

* The value `null` means _the absence of a value_ or _no value_
* The value `null` means _an unknown value_
* The value `null` is a nuisance and I hate it and wish it were never invented

During your software programming career, you will likely have all three of those
opinions, sometimes at the same time. Let's take a look at some examples to try
to figure this out.

## The absence of a value

Let's say you wrote a function that splits a string into words, reverses them,
and puts them back together in reverse order. You can do that with the methods

* `String#split` [link][split];
* `Array#reverse` [link][reverse]; and,
* `Array#join` [link][join].

That function could look like this.

```js
function reverseTheSentence(sentence) {
  let parts = sentence.split(' ');
  parts.reverse();
  return parts.join(' ');
}
```

That's great! It works! But, what happens if someone doesn't care about what
your function and just decides to pass in something that's not a string? It
would make sense that reversing something that is not a string should lead to no
value, the absence of a value, because the input to the function doesn't make
sense. In that case, you can just return a `null` because there is _no value_
that the function can return that would make sense.

```js
function reverseTheSentence(sentence) {
  if (typeof sentence !== 'string') {
    return null;
  }
  let parts = sentence.split(' ');
  parts.reverse();
  return parts.join(' ');
}
```

## An unknown value

There are a lot of programmers that will argue that `null` cannot be an unknown
value. "The value is known!" they'll exclaim. "The value is 'null'! It's known!
It's 'null'! Stop saying it's not known!"

There are programmers that vehemently disagree with that.

![shrug](images/woman-shrugging_1f937-200d-2640-fe0f.png)

## Checking if a value is null

If you had hoped that you could use the `typeof` operator to check if a value is
`null`, then you're out of luck.

```js
// Useless code.
console.log(typeof null);  // 'object'
```

Silly JavaScript. Instead of using the `typeof` operator, you can just _compare_
the value to `null` because there is only one value of the Null data type and
it's always `null`. Take a look at the following code and figure out what you
think it will produce.

```js
let a = [];
let x = null;

if (a === null) {
  console.log('a is null');
} else if (x === null) {
  console.log('x is null');
}
```

## Oh, and there's that undefined value, too

Just like the `null` value that is the only value of the Null data type, there
is `undefined` which is the only value of the Undefined data type.

If you're asking yourself, "Wait, if 'null' is no value or the absence of a
value, then what the heck does 'undefined' mean?", well you're not the only one.

Have a look at this code.

```js
let value;

value = 6.28;
console.log(value);
```

You probably will not be surprised to see that it will print out "6.28" because
that's the value of `value`. But, what if you did this? What does that new
`console.log` print?

```js
let value;
console.log(value); // <- what does this print?

value = 6.28;
console.log(value);
```

If you guessed that it prints "undefined", you're right! When you declare a
variable, it's very first value is `undefined`. Most of the time, though, you'll
just immediately set it to a value.

```js
let value = 6.28;
```

So, an uninitialized variable has the value `undefined` which is the only value
of the Undefined data type. To test for it, you can use the `typeof` operator
_or_ the strict equality operator. Using the strict equality operator is the
more common way to do that, now.

```js
// Test if a value is undefined
if (value === undefined) {
  // do a thing
}

// You can also do it this way, but
// it is considered passé.
if (typeof value === 'undefined') {
  // do a thing
}
```

## What happens when...

Interestingly enough, all functions actually _do_ return values. Have a look at
this function. What value does it return? (Not a trick question.)

```js
function returnsTrue() {
  return true;
}
```

Yes, it returns the value `true`. But, what about this function?

```js
function returnsWhat() {
  return;
}
```

There's a `return` statement there but it does not specify a value. If there is
not value specified, what do you think this function returns? Try putting the
function definition above and the code below into a code runner and seeing what
happens.

```js
console.log(returnsWhat());
```

One you figure that out, try the same experiment but with this function. What
do you think it returns. It doesn't even have a `return` statement in it!

```js
function whatIsThis() {
}
```

## What you've learned

There is a special value in JavaScript represented as `null` which means "no
value" or "unknown value". It is the only value of the Null data type. You can
check that a value is `null` by using the strict equality operator `x === null`.

The value `undefined` is used by JavaScript for variables that have not been
assigned a value. Also, functions that do not return an explicit value return
the value `undefined`. You can test if a value is `undefined` by using the
strict equality operator `x === undefined`.

# Catch Me If You Can

Sometimes bad things happen to good programs. Some person may enter some badly
formatted information. Another computer may try to attack your program by
sending it wonky data. A network could go down. A file can become corrupt. When
this happens, your running software will have some errors. This article is about
how you can recover from those errors with "structured exception handling".

In this article you'll learn the answers to:

* What _is_ structured exception handling?
* How can I do that in JavaScript?
* How can I make my own errors?
* What else can I do with it?
* Shouldn't I just always do this?

## Structured exception handling

Oddly enough, there are very few error-handling mechanisms in use, today, in all
programming languages. There are really only three ways that programming
language provide structured exception handling.

* **Error or error code reporting** as found in languages like C and Go
* **Continuable exceptions** as found in Common Lisp
* **Stack unwinding** which is found in almost every modern programming
  language including JavaScript and Python

In the stack-unwinding paradigm, which is the one you'll use in JavaScript, when
an error occurs, the JavaScript interpreter (the thing running your JavaScript
code) looks for some kind of handler for that error. It has a very specific way
of searching for those handlers. The way JavaScript searches for the handlers is
very similar to the way it happens in Python, C++, Java, C#, and a lot of other
languages. Once you learn it, here, you will be able to handle errors when
writing code in all of those languages.

## Try and catch

Say you have some code that may have an error. For example:

```js
function sumArray(array) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```

If someone calls the above function with the code `sumArray(null)`, then they
will get the error because the `for` loop is trying to get the `length` property
of the `array` parameter which is `null`.

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null
```

To prevent this from ruining your program, you wrap code that may have an error
in a **try block**. Now, you've seen other blocks already: `if` blocks, `for`
blocks, `function` blocks. Basically, if there are curly braces around some
lines of code, that's a **code block** of some kind. A _try block_ is just some
curly braces with the `try` keyword.

```js
// THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE BLOCK OF CODE
function sumArray(array) {
  let sum = 0;

  // The try block wraps the for loop. If some
  // error occurs, the try block will give you
  // a chance to react to it so that the program
  // doesn't terminate.
  try {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) {
      sum += array[i];
    }
  } // needs something more here

  return sum;
}
```

The `try` block tells JavaScript that it needs to watch the code inside the
curly braces for an error. Now, you have to tell JavaScript what to do when
there _is_ an error. You do that in the `catch` block that should immediately
follow the `try` block. The `catch` block accepts a single parameter that
(usually) contains an object that describes the error that occurred. In the
case of the `sumArray` method, if an error occurs, you could return the value
`undefined` rather than letting an error terminate your program. You could also
log the error to the "error" output.

```js
function sumArray(array) {
  let sum = 0;

  try {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) {
      sum += array[i];
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
    return null;
  }

  return sum;
}

sumArray(null);
```

Just to state it, again: the _catch block_ runs when an error occurs in the _try
block_. If no error occurs in the _try block_, the _catch block_ **does not
run**.

That `(e)` after the word `catch` is a variable that contains any error that was
thrown and caught by this `try-catch` block. It doesn't have to be named `e`.

```js
function sumArray(array) {
  let sum = 0;

  try {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) {
      sum += array[i];
    }
  } catch (pancakes) {
    console.log(pancakes);
    return null;
  }

  return sum;
}

sumArray(null);
```

Here is the same code but, instead of a variable named "e", there is a variable
named "pancakes". Now, if an error is thrown, the variable "pancakes" will
contain it. By long-standing tradition, the variables used with the catch block
are normally "e", "err", or "error".

```js
// CODE SNIPPET, WILL NOT RUN
} catch (e) {
```

```js
// CODE SNIPPET, WILL NOT RUN
} catch (err) {
```

```js
// CODE SNIPPET, WILL NOT RUN
} catch (error) {
```

Now, when you run the code `sumArray(null)`, you should see something like the
following, if you run it in the online code editor.

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null
  at sumArray (/tmp/file.js:5:31)
  at Object.<anonymous> (/tmp/file.js:16:1)
  at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1158:30)
  at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1178:10)
  at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1002:32)
  at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:901:14)
  at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (internal/modules/run_main.js:74:12)
  at internal/main/run_main_module.js:18:47
```

In that code sample, after the `sumArray(null)` call, the lines that begins
`TypeError` is the error that occurred. The next 10 lines are what is known as a
**stack trace**. You'll end up seeing these a lot, most likely, as you continue
your career in software programming. This is the first line in understanding
errors in your code. The _stack trace_ shows on the first line where the error
occurred: `sumArray (/tmp/file.js:5:31)` means that it occurred in the
`sumArray` method on line 5 of the content, at character 31. If you open up one
of the coding problems, paste that code block in, and run it, you'll see similar
output in the output block.

The last line `undefined` is the return value of the `sumArray(null)` invocation
that now happens when an error occurs.

That is how the so-called **try-catch block** works.

## How can I make my own errors?

To create your own errors with structured exception handling, you first need to
create an error object with the message that describes the error. Then, you need
to "throw" the error. That code would look like either of these two lines, the
only difference being the `new` keyword. They both work exactly the same.

```js
throw Error('this happened because I wanted it to');
throw new Error('this happened because I wanted it to');
```

## What else is there?

Turns out that you can have one more block on the _try-catch block_. It is the
**finally block**. The _finally block_ runs whether or not an error occurs. It
_always_ runs.

```js
function sumArray(array) {
  let sum = 0;

  try {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) {
      sum += array[i];
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
    return null;
  } finally {
    console.log('you will always see this.');
  }

  return sum;
}
```

## How do I best use this?

At this point, you may be asking yourself, "Self, since errors can occur
everywhere, shouldn't I just wrap _all_ of my code in these _try-catch blocks_?"

No. No, you shouldn't.

Every **try-catch block** introduces another slow-down in your code. If you're
writing code that you want to run as fast as possible, then you write as few
_try-catch blocks_ as possible. Also, it makes the code pretty cluttered with
all of the indentation and curly braces. When at all possible, you should write
**defensive code** which checks for bad values before errors get thrown in your
code. Rather than using a _try-catch block_ in the `sumArray` function, you
could defend against bad values of the `array` parameter like so.

```js
function sumArray(array) {
  if (array === null) {
    return null;
  }

  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```

## What you learned

The _try-catch-finally block_ is a mechanism to handle errors in your code. You
should _not_ wrap all of your code in these blocks because it can seriously
degrade the performance of your application. Instead, only wrap those portions
of the code that you want to guard against throwing exceptions.

A better choice, in JavaScript and all programming languages, is to be
defensive about your programming and choose to check that the value that you
have has the functionality that you desire by adding code like

```js
if (value !== undefined) {}
if (value !== null) {}
```
