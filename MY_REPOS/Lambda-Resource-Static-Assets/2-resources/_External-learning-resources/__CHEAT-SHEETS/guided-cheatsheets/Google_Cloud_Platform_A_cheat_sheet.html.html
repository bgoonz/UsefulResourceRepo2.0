  <p>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a portfolio of cloud computing services that grew around the initial Google App
    Engine framework for hosting web applications from Google's data centers. Since the launch of Google App Engine in
    2008, GCP has grown into one of the premier cloud computing platforms on the market, though it still trails Amazon
    Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure in terms of market share. That said, Google continues to hold its own in the
    cloud wars and continues to make investments in GCP to make it competitive with other public cloud providers, and
    more attractive to big customers. (<strong>Note:</strong> This article about the <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/google-cloud-platform-an-insider-s-guide-free-pdf/">Google
      Cloud Platform is also available as a free PDF download</a>.)</p>
  <p>To help CXOs, IT leaders, operations administrators, and developers better understand Google's role as a cloud
    provider, we've put together the most important details and resources in this cheat sheet. This is a “living"
    article that will be updated and refreshed as new, relevant information becomes public. </p>

  <h2 id="what-is-google-cloud-platform">What is Google Cloud Platform?</h2>
  <p>To capture the growing interest in web applications, Google App Engine was launched in April 2008 as a Platform as
    a Service (PaaS) resource allowing developers to build and host apps on Google's infrastructure. App Engine came out
    of preview in September 2011, and the Google Cloud Platform name was formally adopted in 2013.</p>
  <p>Since the introduction of Google App Engine, the company subsequently released a variety of complementary tools,
    such as its data storage layer, and its Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) component known as the Google Compute
    Engine, which supports the use of virtual machines. After growing as an IaaS provider, Google added additional
    products including a load balancer, DNS, monitoring tools, and data analysis services, bringing GCP closer to
    feature parity with AWS and Azure, making it better able to compete in the cloud market.</p>

  <p>Google Cloud Platform is primarily a public cloud provider, though Google has dramatically increased its focus on
    <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/hybrid-cloud-the-smart-persons-guide/">hybrid</a> and <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/multicloud-the-smart-persons-guide/">multicloud</a> workloads using <a

  <h2 id="why-does-google-cloud-platform-matter">Why does Google Cloud Platform matter?</h2>
  <p>Google Cloud Platform offers the same core data storage and virtual machine functionality of AWS and Azure, or any
    other cloud provider. Google's strength lies in big data processing tools, artificial intelligence (AI) and <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/machine-learning-the-smart-persons-guide/">machine learning</a>
    initiatives, and <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/containers-the-smart-persons-guide/">container</a>
    support.</p>
  <p>Google's BigQuery and Dataflow bring strong analytics and processing capabilities for companies that work heavily
    with data, while Google's <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/kubernetes-the-smart-persons-guide/">Kubernetes</a> container
    technology allows for container cluster management and eases container deployment. Google's <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-cloud-machine-learning-engine-the-smart-persons-guide/">Cloud
      Machine Learning Engine</a> and various machine learning APIs make it easier for businesses to leverage AI in the
    cloud.</p>
  <p>Google is a company that thrives on the collection and subsequent leveraging of data. Whether that is user data,
    machine data, or geographic data is irrelevant-if an enterprise wants to experiment with data, Google Cloud Platform
    may be a good option as a cloud provider.</p>
  <p>Data privacy and security features are also very mature in Google Cloud Platform. <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/access-transparency/">Access Transparency</a> creates near-real time logs of when
    GCP support representatives or system engineers interact with your data. Similarly, Access Approval-available in
    beta-allows clients to actively approve or deny access to stored data or configurations to Google administrators.

  <h2 id="who-does-google-cloud-platform-affect">Who does Google Cloud Platform affect?</h2>
  <p>As with many of Google's innovations, the set of tools that Google Cloud Platform comprises were originally
    internal tools built for internal use. This eventually proved problematic. Google originally targeted cloud services
    for startups and SMBs, <a
      href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-cloud-platform-sets-up-new-global-startup-fund/">offering up to
      $100,000 of Cloud Platform and Firebase credits</a> to startups. However, limited uptake prompted Google to make
    GCP more adaptable for diverse use cases.</p>
  <p>At the outset, Google expected users to build apps the same way Google did, though this philosophy is counter to
    the way enterprise app development tends to occur. In 2016, Google pivoted, <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-admits-original-enterprise-cloud-strategy-was-wrong-why-its-gone-in-a-different/">admitting
      this was the wrong approach</a>, with then-Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt stating that “We decided to
    meet you where you are, as opposed to where we think you should be."</p>
  <p>Google subsequently added more utilities to ease the transition to Cloud Platform, making the platform more
    accessible to businesses of any size looking to decommission some or all of their data centers.</p>
  <p>It seems that large corporations are paying attention. In 2016, Google <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-cloud-platform-signs-up-enterprise-giants-how-does-it-compare-to-aws/">added
      big names to its Cloud Platform roster</a>, including Disney, Coca-Cola, Spotify, Apple, <a
      href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-cloud-touts-major-enterprise-customers-as-it-runs-to-catch-up-to-aws/">Colgate-Palmolive,
      and Home Depot</a>, among others, proving that it can cater to the needs of major players. In 2018, <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/twitter-chooses-google-cloud-what-it-means-for-enterprise-cloud-adoption/">Twitter
      announced its adoption of Google Cloud Platform</a>, migrating 300 petabytes of data to the platform. Accenture
    and Deloitte announced expansions of their GCP alliances in 2019, with Google focusing on <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-google-cloud-for-retail-will-help-digitally-transform-shopping/">GCP
      capabilities to transform shopping experiences</a>. By early 2021, <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/customers">Google's list of high-profile Cloud clients</a> includes simply too many
    to list individually.</p>
  <p>Many of these companies also use other platforms such as AWS or Azure, which means that GCP could also act as a
    complementary provider for existing AWS or Azure customers who need additional capabilities or flexibility.</p>
  <p>Since it is a platform on which applications are built and hosted, the choice of a cloud provider also affects
    developers. For developers, Google Cloud Platform supports Go, Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, .NET, and Java.
    Developers should make sure they are involved in any conversations about selecting a cloud provider to ensure it is
    a platform that they, and their team, are comfortable working in.</p>
  <p>As Google continues to expand its cloud offerings to compete with other providers and “<a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/how-businesses-can-transform-digitally-with-google-cloud">accelerate
      digital transformation</a>," the range of who it affects will continue to grow. Any business with plans for
    large-scale data analytics, AI or ML development, remote collaboration, or one of the many X-as-a-Service products
    available in the cloud can expect Google Cloud to have some impact on them in the years to come. </p>

  <h2 id="when-was-google-cloud-platform-announced">When was Google Cloud Platform announced?</h2>
  <p>As mentioned, Google's first foray into cloud services was the <a
      href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/developers-start-your-engines.html">Google App Engine back in
      2008</a>. Two years later, Google announced that it was adding a storage layer and, in 2012, the company began its
    partner program for the platform. Then came BigQuery, the Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and the rest of the tools that
    make up today's Google Cloud Platform.</p>
  <p>However, like all providers, Google constantly adds new tools and features in preview, alpha, or beta, which will
    likely make it to the general public.</p>
  <p>Some of the latest products added to Google Cloud Platform are Cloud Inference API, allowing developers to run
    large-scale correlations over datasets, Shielded VMs, Cloud Tasks, Cloud IoT Edge, Cloud AutoML, and the AI Hub,
    allowing developers to share and deploy AI technologies on Google Cloud.</p>
  <p>At Google Cloud Next 2019, further enhancements to GCP's AI capabilities were announced. <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/">AI Platform</a> allows developers, data scientists, and data
    engineers to collaborate on machine learning projects. New capabilities were added to <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/automl/">Cloud AutoML</a>, now allowing for data from structured tables and video
    content to be classified automatically. Likewise, the existing AutoML Vision has an <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs/terminology">edge computing variant</a>.</p>
  <p>Google Cloud Next 2020, which was all online over the course of eight weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, brought
    the announcement of several new features, such as beta testing of Confidential VMs, which encrypt data in use while
    being processed. <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-cloud-announces-bigquery-omni-multicloud-analytics-solution/">BigQuery
      Omni</a>, a cross-platform cloud analytics tool, was also announced, as were other <a

  <h2 id="how-can-i-use-google-cloud-platform">How can I use Google Cloud Platform?</h2>
  <p>Since Google Cloud Platform is a publicly-available product, it's not very difficult to acquire its services. The
    bigger issue is two-fold: Deciding whether or not the platform is the best option for your business, and planning
    your migration.</p>
  <p>To effectively compare Google Cloud Platform against the other options out there, you need to do your research. If
    you are looking at comparing it against AWS and Microsoft Azure, try starting with our other smart person's guides
    for <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/amazon-web-services-the-smart-persons-guide/">AWS</a> and <a
      href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-azure-the-smart-persons-guide/">Microsoft Azure</a>,
    respectively. A list of other good cloud vendors can be found in this <a
      href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-15-most-important-hybrid-cloud-vendors/">list of 15 of the top hybrid cloud
      vendors</a>.</p>
  <p>As your organization begins to plan its deployment, start by making a list of questions you have about the service
    and check them against the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/faq">FAQ section</a> on the Google Cloud
    Platform website. To understand the specifics of a GCP deployment, make sure you familiarize yourself with <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/">the proper documentation</a>.</p>
  <p>Google does offer a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/">free tier</a> for Cloud Platform, as well as a <a
      href="https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?_ga=1.144971252.1119317518.1453479728&amp;pli=1&amp;page=0">free
      12-month trial</a> with credit for organizations that may need to dip their toes in the water. Google offers free
    credits to select startups working with affiliated investors, incubators, or accelerators through the <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/developers/startups/">Google Cloud for Startups</a> promotion. A tool for live
    migrations is also offered (simply titled <a
      href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/live-migration">Live Migration</a>), which allows a virtual
    machine instance to keep running even during a host system event.</p>
