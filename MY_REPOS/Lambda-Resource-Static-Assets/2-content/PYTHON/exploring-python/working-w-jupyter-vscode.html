<p>Working with Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Jupyter</a> (formerly IPython Notebook) is an open-source project that lets you easily combine Markdown text and executable Python source code on one canvas called a <strong>notebook</strong>. Visual Studio Code supports working with Jupyter Notebooks natively, as well as through <a href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/docs/python/jupyter-support-py">Python code files</a>. This topic covers the native support available for Jupyter Notebooks and demonstrates how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create, open, and save Jupyter Notebooks</li>
<li>Work with Jupyter code cells</li>
<li>View, inspect, and filter variables using the Variable explorer and Data viewer</li>
<li>Connect to a remote Jupyter server</li>
<li>Debug a Jupyter notebook</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-your-environment">Setting up your environment<a href="#_setting-up-your-environment">#</a></h2>
<p>To work with Jupyter notebooks, you must activate an Anaconda environment in VS Code, or another Python environment in which you’ve installed the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/">Jupyter package</a>. To select an environment, use the <strong>Python: Select Interpreter</strong> command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).</p>
<p>Once the appropriate environment is activated, you can create and open a Jupyter Notebook, connect to a remote Jupyter server for running code cells, and export a Jupyter Notebook as a Python file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> By default, the Visual Studio Code Python extension will open a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) in the Notebook Editor. If you want to disable this behavior you can turn it off in settings. (Python &gt; Data Science: Use Notebook Editor).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="create-or-open-a-jupyter-notebook">Create or open a Jupyter Notebook<a href="#_create-or-open-a-jupyter-notebook">#</a></h2>
<p>You can create a Jupyter Notebook by running the <strong>Jupyter: Create Blank New Jupyter Notebook</strong> command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) or by creating a new .ipynb file in your workspace. When you select the file, the Notebook Editor is launched allowing you to edit and run code cells.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>If you have an existing Jupyter Notebook, you can open it in the Notebook Editor by double-clicking on the file and opening with Visual Studio Code, through the Visual Studio Code, or using the Command Palette <strong>Jupyter: Open in Notebook Editor</strong> command.</p>
<p>Once you have a Notebook created, you can run a code cell using the green run icon above the cell and the output will appear directly below the code cell.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2 id="trusted-notebooks">Trusted Notebooks<a href="#_trusted-notebooks">#</a></h2>
<p>It’s possible for malicious source code to be contained in a Jupyter Notebook. With that in mind, to help protect you, any Notebook that’s not created with VS Code on your local machine (or explicitly set to <strong>Trusted</strong> by you) is considered <strong>Not Trusted</strong>. When a Notebook is <strong>Not Trusted</strong>, VS Code will not render Markdown cells or display the output of code cells within the Notebook. Instead, just the source of Markdown and code cells will be shown. The Notebook is essentially in read-only mode, with toolbars disabled and no ability to edit the file, until you set it as <strong>Trusted</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Before setting a Notebook as <strong>Trusted</strong>, it is up to you to verify that the source code and Markdown are safe to run. VS Code does not perform any sanitizing of Markdown, it merely prevents it from being rendered until a Notebook is marked as <strong>Trusted</strong> to help protect you from malicious code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you first open a Notebook that’s <strong>Not Trusted</strong>, the following notification prompt is displayed.</p>
<figure>
<img src="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/assets/docs/python/jupyter/native-trusted-prompt.png" alt="Trusted Notebook prompt" /><figcaption>Trusted Notebook prompt</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you select <strong>Trust</strong>, the Notebook will be trusted going forward. If you opt not to trust the Notebook, then <strong>Not Trusted</strong> will be displayed in the toolbar and the Notebook will remain in a read-only state as described previously. If you select <strong>Trust all notebooks</strong>, you will be taken to settings, where you can specify that all Notebooks opened in VS Code be trusted. That means you will no longer be prompted to trust individual notebooks and harmful code could automatically run.</p>

</figure>
<p>You can relaunch the trust notification prompt after reviewing the Notebook by clicking on the <strong>Not Trusted</strong> status.</p>
<h2 id="save-your-jupyter-notebook">Save your Jupyter Notebook<a href="#_save-your-jupyter-notebook">#</a></h2>
<p>You can save your Jupyter Notebook using the keyboard combo Ctrl+S or through the save icon on the Notebook Editor toolbar.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> At present, you must use the methods discussed above to save your Notebook. The <strong>File</strong>&gt;<strong>Save</strong> menu does not save your Notebook, just the toolbar icon or keyboard command.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="export-your-jupyter-notebook">Export your Jupyter Notebook<a href="#_export-your-jupyter-notebook">#</a></h2>
<p>You can export a Jupyter Notebook as a Python file (.py), a PDF, or an HTML file. To export, just click the convert icon on the main toolbar. You’ll then be presented with file options from the Command Palette.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For PDF export, you must have TeX installed. If you don’t, you will be notified that you need to install it when you select the PDF option. Also, be aware that if you have SVG-only output in your Notebook, they will not be displayed in the PDF. To have SVG graphics in a PDF, either ensure that your output includes a non-SVG image format or else you can first export to HTML and then save as PDF using your browser.</p>

<h2 id="work-with-code-cells-in-the-notebook-editor">Work with code cells in the Notebook Editor<a href="#_work-with-code-cells-in-the-notebook-editor">#</a></h2>
<p>The Notebook Editor makes it easy to create, edit, and run code cells within your Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-code-cell">Create a code cell<a href="#_create-a-code-cell">#</a></h3>
<p>By default, a blank Notebook will have an empty code cell for you to start with and an existing Notebook will place one at the bottom. Add your code to the empty code cell to get started.</p>
<pre><code>msg = &quot;Hello world&quot;
print(msg)</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/assets/docs/python/jupyter/native-code-cells-02.png" alt="Simple Jupyter code cell" /><figcaption>Simple Jupyter code cell</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="code-cell-modes">Code cell modes<a href="#_code-cell-modes">#</a></h3>
<p>While working with code cells a cell can be in three states, unselected, command mode, and edit mode. The current state of a cell is indicated by a vertical bar to the left of a code cell. When no bar is visible, the cell is unselected.</p>
<figure>
<img src="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/assets/docs/python/jupyter/native-code-cells-02.png" alt="Unselected Jupyter code cell" /><figcaption>Unselected Jupyter code cell</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An unselected cell isn’t editable, but you can hover over it to reveal additional cell specific toolbar options. These additional toolbar options appear directly below and to the left of the cell. You’ll also see when hovering over a cell that an empty vertical bar is present to the left.</p>
<figure>
<img src="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/assets/docs/python/jupyter/native-code-cells-02a.png" alt="Simple Jupyter code cell being hovered over" /><figcaption>Simple Jupyter code cell being hovered over</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When a cell is selected, it can be in two different modes. It can be in command mode or in edit mode. When the cell is in command mode, it can be operated on and accept keyboard commands. When the cell is in edit mode, the cell’s contents (code or Markdown) can be modified.</p>
<p>When a cell is in command mode, the vertical bar to the left of the cell will be solid to indicate it’s selected.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>To move from edit mode to command mode, press the ESC key. To move from command mode to edit mode, press the Enter key. You can also use the mouse to <strong>change the mode</strong> by clicking the vertical bar to the left of the cell or out of the code/Markdown region in the code cell.</p>
<h3 id="add-additional-code-cells">Add additional code cells<a href="#_add-additional-code-cells">#</a></h3>
<p>Code cells can be added to a Notebook using the main toolbar, a code cell’s vertical toolbar, the add code cell icon at the bottom of the Notebook, the add code cell icon at the top of the Notebook (visible with hover), and through keyboard commands.</p>
<figure>
<img src="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/assets/docs/python/jupyter/native-code-cells-07.png" alt="Add code cells" /><figcaption>Add code cells</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using the plus icon in the main toolbar will add a new cell directly below the currently selected cell. Using the add cell icons at the top and bottom of the Jupyter Notebook, will add a code cell at the top and bottom respectively. And using the add icon in the code cell’s toolbar, will add a new code cell directly below it.</p>
<p>When a code cell is in command mode, the A key can be used to add a cell above and the B can be used to add a cell below the selected cell.</p>
<h3 id="select-a-code-cell">Select a code cell<a href="#_select-a-code-cell">#</a></h3>
<p>The selected code cell can be changed using the mouse, the up/down arrow keys on the keyboard, and the J (down) and K (up) keys. To use the keyboard, the cell must be in command mode.</p>
<h3 id="run-a-single-code-cell">Run a single code cell<a href="#_run-a-single-code-cell">#</a></h3>
<p>Once your code is added, you can run a cell using the green run arrow and the output will be displayed below the code cell.</p>

</figure>
<p>You can also use key combos to run a selected code cell. Ctrl+Enter runs the currently selected cell, Shift+Enter runs the currently selected cell and inserts a new cell immediately below (focus moves to new cell), and Alt+Enter runs the currently selected cell and inserts a new cell immediately below (focus remains on current cell). These keyboard combos can be used in both command and edit modes.</p>
<h3 id="run-multiple-code-cells">Run multiple code cells<a href="#_run-multiple-code-cells">#</a></h3>
<p>Running multiple code cells can be accomplished in a number of ways. You can use the double arrow in the toolbar of the Notebook Editor to run all cells within the Notebook or the run icons with directional arrows to run all cells above or below the current code cell.</p>

<h3 id="undo-your-last-change">Undo your last change<a href="#_undo-your-last-change">#</a></h3>
<p>You can use the z key to undo your previous change, for example, if you’ve made an accidental edit you can undo it to the previous correct state, or if you’ve deleted a cell accidentally you can recover it.</p>
<h3 id="switch-between-code-and-markdown">Switch between code and Markdown<a href="#_switch-between-code-and-markdown">#</a></h3>
<p>The Notebook Editor allows you to easily change code cells between Markdown and code. By default a code cell is set for code, but just click the Markdown icon (or the code icon, if Markdown was previously set) in the code cell’s toolbar to change it.</p>

<h2 id="debug-a-jupyter-notebook">Debug a Jupyter Notebook<a href="#_debug-a-jupyter-notebook">#</a></h2>
<p>If you need additional debug support in order to diagnose an issue in your code cells, you can export it as a Python file. Once exported as a Python file, the Visual Studio Code debugger lets you step through your code, set breakpoints, examine state, and analyze problems. Using the debugger is a helpful way to find and correct issues in notebook code. To debug your Python file:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In VS Code, if you haven’t already, activate a Python environment in which Jupyter is installed.</p></li>
<li><p>From your Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) select the convert button in the main toolbar.</p>
<figure>
<img src="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/assets/docs/python/jupyter/native-toolbar-convert.png" alt="Convert Jupyter Notebook to Python file" /><figcaption>Convert Jupyter Notebook to Python file</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once exported, you’ll have a .py file with your code that you can use for debugging.</p></li>
<li><p>After saving the .py file, to start the debugger, use one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the whole Notebook, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run the <strong>Python: Debug Current File in Python Interactive Window</strong> command.</li>
<li>For an individual cell, use the <strong>Debug Cell</strong> adornment that appears above the cell. The debugger specifically starts on the code in that cell. By default, <strong>Debug Cell</strong> just steps into user code. If you want to step into non-user code, you need to uncheck <strong>Data Science: Debug Just My Code</strong> in the Python extension settings (Ctrl+,).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To familiarize yourself with the general debugging features of VS Code, such as inspecting variables, setting breakpoints, and other activities, review <a href="chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/docs/editor/debugging">VS Code debugging</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>As you find issues, stop the debugger, correct your code, save the file, and start the debugger again.</p></li>
<li><p>When you’re satisfied that all your code is correct, use the Python Interactive window to export the Python file as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="connect-to-a-remote-jupyter-server">Connect to a remote Jupyter server<a href="#_connect-to-a-remote-jupyter-server">#</a></h2>
<p>You can offload intensive computation in a Jupyter Notebook to other computers by connecting to a remote Jupyter server. Once connected, code cells run on the remote server rather than the local computer.</p>
<p>To connect to a remote Jupyter server:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Run the <strong>Jupyter: Specify local or remote Jupyter server for connections</strong> command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).</p></li>
<li><p>When prompted to <strong>Pick how to connect to Jupyter</strong>, select <strong>Existing: Specify the URI of an existing server</strong>.</p>

</figure></li>
<li><p>When prompted to <strong>Enter the URI of a Jupyter server</strong>, provide the server’s URI (hostname) with the authentication token included with a <code>?token=</code> URL parameter. (If you start the server in the VS Code terminal with an authentication token enabled, the URL with the token typically appears in the terminal output from where you can copy it.) Alternatively, you can specify a username and password after providing the URI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For added security, Microsoft recommends configuring your Jupyter server with security precautions such as SSL and token support. This helps ensure that requests sent to the Jupyter server are authenticated and connections to the remoter server are encrypted. For guidance about securing a notebook server, see the <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html#securing-a-notebook-server">Jupyter docs</a>.</p>
