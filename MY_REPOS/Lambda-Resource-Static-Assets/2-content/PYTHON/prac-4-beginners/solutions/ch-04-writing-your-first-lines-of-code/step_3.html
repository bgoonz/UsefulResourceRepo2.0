<p>Write code to tell them how many years you are older than them (negative numbers for younger is fine at this point instead of older / younger with only positive numbers).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_age = 47
&gt;&gt;&gt; response = input(&quot;How old are you? &quot;)
How old are you? 53
&gt;&gt;&gt; their_age = int(response)
&gt;&gt;&gt; diff = their_age - my_age
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f&#39;Great age! You are {diff} years older than me.&#39;)
Great age! You are 6 years older than me. </code></pre>
