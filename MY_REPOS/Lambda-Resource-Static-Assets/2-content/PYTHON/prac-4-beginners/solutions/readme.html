<h1 id="solutions-enabled">Solutions: [Enabled]</h1>
<p>We’ve decided to include the solutions to the practice exercises. Initially, the intention was to omit them. It can be frustrating. However, <strong>it’s working your way through that actually drives the learning</strong>. It feels good to see the solution, but to make it really click, you have to make it your own and work your way through it.</p>
<p>Ideally, this is a <em>check my solution</em> type of thing. You should now see the solutions by chapter above (under construction at the moment.)</p>
<p>Best of luck on the course, Michael!</p>
