# Text-Manipulation-Tools 
These are text manipulation tools which I use for different purposes. I used to use some of them with the help of Notepad++ until I finally decided to create my own script to make it more easier for me to use them.
 
Also, this is one of my test project to gain experience and new skills.

The script was written with Jquery (library), Javascript, HTML and CSS.

# Usage: 

Just copy and paste all the files into your public_html folder and then access it using your domain name or your server ip-address.

You can test the live version here: https://toorhamza.github.io/text-manipulation-tools/

If you are going to use these tools a lot then it is recommended to host them on your own server. The above link is just a demo version where script could be tested.

# Tools
Currently, there are 8 text manipulation tools:
1. Duplicate Text Line Remover (Removes duplicate text lines)
2. Find and Replace (Finds a specific text and replaces it with some other text)
3. Compare Text Files (It compares text files and remove duplicates from one of the files. It is a bit tricky to understand but I personally use to sort data for my web automation tools)
4. Add Prefix/Suffix to lines (Adds some text at the beginning or at the end of each line)
5. White Space remover (It removes all the whitespace within your text. I use it for creating javascript for iMacros for Firefox)
6. Sort Text Lines (It sorts text lines alphabetically in ascending and descending order)
7. Replace Lines Breaks (Replace line breaks with some text. One of the example where it can be used is to convert a normal text file with line breaks to csv type file.)
8. Letter Case Converter (Converts the letter case of your text. Currently , only upper and lower letter cases are supported).

If I got some free, I will try to update this script and add new features. 
If there is a fault then please let me know.
Feel free to modify the script if you want to. The instructions of all the functions are given as comments in the js file.
