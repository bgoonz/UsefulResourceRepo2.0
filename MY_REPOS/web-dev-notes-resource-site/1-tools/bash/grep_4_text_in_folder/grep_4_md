To search for text in files from the current folder (or directory, to follow Linux nomenclature), one can write:

grep "text" -R . -n --include=*.py 

The parameters are as follows:

text                    the actual text to search for
-R                      Recurse to subdirectories
.                       start from the current directory
–include=*.py           specifies a regular expression that searchable files must match (e.g. *.py)
–color                  makes the output pretty
-n                      shows the lines numbers of the lines that matched your search text
