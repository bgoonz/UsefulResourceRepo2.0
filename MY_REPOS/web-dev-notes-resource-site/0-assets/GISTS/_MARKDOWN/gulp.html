    <p>https://css-tricks.com/the-simplest-ways-to-handle-html-includes/</p>
    <p>
      Use Gulp What’s even faster than a server-side include? If the include is
      preprocessed before it’s even on the server. Gulp has a variety of
      processors that can do this. One is gulp-file-include.
    </p>
    <p>That would look like this:</p>
    …
    <body>
      <p>
        @<span class="citation" data-cites="include">@include</span
        >(‘./header.html’)
      </p>
      <p>Content</p>
      @<span class="citation" data-cites="include">@include</span
      >(‘./footer.html’)
    </body>
    <p>… And you’d process it like:</p>
    <p>
      var fileinclude = require(‘gulp-file-include’), gulp = require(‘gulp’);
    </p>
    <p>
      gulp.task(‘fileinclude’, function() { gulp.src([‘index.html’])
      .pipe(fileinclude({ prefix: ‘@@’, basepath: ‘<span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="file"
        >@file</span
      >’ })) .pipe(gulp.dest(‘./’)); }); Looks like this particular plugin has
      fancy features where you can pass in variables to the includes, making it
      possible to make little data-driven components.
