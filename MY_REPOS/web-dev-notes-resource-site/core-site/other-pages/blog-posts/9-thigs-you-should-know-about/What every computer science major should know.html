      <p>1.) http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/
        2.)
        Given the expansive growth in the field, it's become challenging to discern what belongs in a modern computer
        science degree.</p>
      <p>My own faculty is engaging in this debate, so I've coalesced my thoughts as an answer to the question, "What
        should every computer science major know?"</p>
      <p>I've tried to answer this question as the conjunction of four concerns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What should every student know to get a good job?</li>
        <li>What should every student know to maintain lifelong employment?</li>
        <li>What should every student know to enter graduate school?</li>
        <li>What should every student know to benefit society?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My thoughts below factor into both general principles and specific recommendations relevant to the modern
        computing landscape.</p>
      <p>Computer science majors: feel free to use this as a self-study guide.</p>
      <p>Please email or <a class="btn" href="http://www.twitter.com/mattmight">tweet</a> with suggestions for addition and
        deletion.</p>
      <p><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks for the suggestions and reminders! I'll incorporate them as I receive them to
        keep this a living document.</p>
      <h2 id="portfolioversusresume">Portfolio versus resume</h2>
      <p>Having emerged from engineering and mathematics, computer science programs take a resume-based approach to
        hiring off their graduates.</p>
      <p>A <em>resume</em> says nothing of a programmer's ability.</p>
      <p>Every computer science major should build a <em>portfolio</em>.</p>
      <p>A portfolio could be as simple as a personal blog, with a post for each project or accomplishment. A better
        portfolio would include per-project pages, and publicly browsable code (hosted perhaps on github or Google
        code).</p>
      <p>Contributions to open source should be linked and documented.</p>
      <p>A code portfolio allows employers to directly judge ability.</p>
      <p>GPAs and resumes do not.</p>
      <p>Professors should design course projects to impress on portfolios, and students, at the conclusion of each
        course, should take time to update them.</p>
      <h2 id="technicalcommunication">Technical communication</h2>
      <p>Lone wolves in computer science are an endangered species.</p>
      <p>Modern computer scientists must practice persuasively and clearly communicating their ideas to non-programmers.
      </p>
      <p>In smaller companies, whether or not a programmer can communicate her ideas to management may make the
        difference between the company's success and failure.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, this is not something fixed with the addition of a single class (although a solid course in
        technical communication doesn't hurt).</p>
      <p>More classes need to provide students the opportunity to present their work and defend their ideas with oral
        presentations.</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations">Specific recommendations</h3>
      <p>I would recommend that students master a presentation tool like PowerPoint or (my favorite) Keynote. (Sorry, as
        much as I love them, LaTeX-based presentation tools are just too static.)</p>
      <p>For producing beautiful mathematical documentation, LaTeX has no equal. All written assignments in technical
        courses should be submitted in LaTeX.</p>
      <h2 id="anengineeringcore">An engineering core</h2>
      <p>Computer science is not quite engineering.</p>
      <p>But, it's close enough.</p>
      <p>Computer scientists <em>will</em> find themselves working with engineers.</p>
      <p>Computer scientists and traditional engineers need to speak the same language--a language rooted in real
        analysis, linear algebra, probability and physics.</p>
      <p>Computer scientists ought to take physics through electromagnetism. But, to do that, they'll need take up
        through multivariate calculus, (and differential equations for good measure).</p>
      <p>In constructing sound simulations, a command of probability and (often times) linear algebra is invaluable. In
        interpreting results, there is no substitute for a solid understanding of statistics.</p>
      <h2 id="theunixphilosophy">The Unix philosophy</h2>
      <p>Computer scientists should be comfortable with and practiced in the Unix philosophy of computing.</p>
      <p>The Unix philosophy (as opposed to Unix itself) is one that emphasizes linguistic abstraction and composition
        in order to effect computation.</p>
      <p>In practice, this means becoming comfortable with the notion of command-line computing, text-file configuration
        and IDE-less software development.</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-1">Specific recommendations</h3>
      <p>Given the prevalence of Unix systems, computer scientists today should be fluent in basic Unix, including the
        ability to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>navigate and manipulate the filesystem;</li>
        <li>compose processes with pipes;</li>
        <li>comfortably edit a file with  <code class="language-javascript">emacs</code> <em>and</em>  <code class="language-javascript">vim</code>;</li>
        <li>create, modify and execute a Makefile for a software project;</li>
        <li>write simple shell scripts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Students will reject the Unix philosophy unless they understand its power. Thus, it's best to challenge
        students to complete useful tasks for which Unix has a comparative advantage, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find the five folders in a given directory consuming the most space.</li>
        <li>Report duplicate MP3s (by file contents, not file name) on a computer.</li>
        <li>Take a list of names whose first and last names have been lower-cased, and properly recapitalize them.</li>
        <li>Find all words in English that have  <code class="language-javascript">x</code> as their second letter, and  <code class="language-javascript">n</code> as their
          second-to-last.</li>
        <li>Directly route your microphone input over the network to another computer's speaker.</li>
        <li>Replace all spaces in a filename with underscore for a given directory.</li>
        <li>Report the last ten errant accesses to the web server coming from a specific IP address.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="systemsadministration">Systems administration</h2>
      <p>Some computer scientists sneer at systems administration as an "IT" task.</p>
      <p>The thinking is that a computer scientist can teach herself how to do anything a technician can do.</p>
      <p>This is true. (In theory.)</p>
      <p>Yet this attitude is misguided: computer scientists must be able to competently and securely administer their
        own systems and networks.</p>
      <p>Many tasks in software development are most efficiently executed without passing through a systems
        administrator.</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-2">Specific recommendations</h3>
      <p>Every modern computer scientist should be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install and administer a Linux distribution.</li>
        <li>Configure and compile the Linux kernel.</li>
        <li>Troubleshoot a connection with  <code class="language-javascript">dig</code>,  <code class="language-javascript">ping</code> and  <code class="language-javascript">traceroute</code>.</li>
        <li>Compile and configure a web server like apache.</li>
        <li>Compile and configure a DNS daemon like bind.</li>
        <li>Maintain a web site with a text editor.</li>
        <li><a class="btn" href="http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-make-your-own-cat-5-ethernet-cable/">Cut and crimp a network
            cable</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="programminglanguages">Programming languages</h2>
      <p>Programming languages rise and fall with the solar cycle.</p>
      <p>A programmer's career should not.</p>
      <p>While it is important to teach languages relevant to employers, it is equally important that students learn how
        to teach themselves new languages.</p>
      <p>The best way to learn how to learn progamming languages is to learn multiple programming languages and
        programming paradigms.</p>
      <p>The difficulty of learning the <em>n</em>th language is half the difficulty of the (_n-1_)th.</p>
      <p>Yet, to <em>truly</em> understand programming languages, one must implement one. Ideally, every computer
        science major would take a compilers class. At a minimum, every computer science major should implement an
        interpreter.</p>
      <h3 id="specificlanguages">Specific languages</h3>
      <p>The following languages provide a reasonable mixture of paradigms and practical applications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Racket;</li>
        <li>C;</li>
        <li>JavaScript;</li>
        <li>Squeak;</li>
        <li>Java;</li>
        <li>Standard ML;</li>
        <li>Prolog;</li>
        <li>Scala;</li>
        <li>Haskell;</li>
        <li>C++; and</li>
        <li>Assembly.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="racket">Racket</h4>
      <p>Racket, as a full-featured dialect of Lisp, has an aggressively simple syntax.</p>
      <p>For a small fraction of students, this syntax is an impediment.</p>
      <p>To be blunt, if these students have a fundamental mental barrier to accepting an alien syntactic regime even
        temporarily, they lack the mental dexterity to survive a career in computer science.</p>
      <p>Racket's powerful macro system and facilities for higher-order programming thoroughly erase the line between
        data and code.</p>
      <p>If taught correctly, Lisp liberates.</p>
      <h4 id="ansic">ANSI C</h4>
      <p>C is a terse and unforgiving abstraction of silicon.</p>
      <p>C remains without rival in programming embedded systems.</p>
      <p>Learning C imparts a deep understanding of the dominant von Neumann architecture in a way that no other
        language can.</p>
      <p>Given the intimate role poor C programming plays in the prevalence of the buffer overflow security
        vulnerabilities, it is critical that programmers learn how to program C properly.</p>
      <h4 id="javascript">JavaScript</h4>
      <p>JavaScript is a good representative of the semantic model popular in dynamic, higher-order languages such as
        Python, Ruby and Perl.</p>
      <p>As the native language of the web, its pragmatic advantages are unique.</p>
      <p>Squeak is a modern dialect of Smalltalk, purest of object-oriented languages.</p>
      <p>It imparts the essence of "object-oriented."</p>
      <h4 id="java">Java</h4>
      <p>Java will remain popular for too long to ignore it.</p>
      <h4 id="standardml">Standard ML</h4>
      <p>Standard ML is a clean embodiment of the Hindley-Milner system.</p>
      <p>The Hindley-Milner type system is one of the greatest (yet least-known) achievements in modern computing.</p>
      <p>Though exponential in complexity, type inference in Hindley-Milner is always fast for programs of human
        interest.</p>
      <p>The type system is rich enough to allow the expression of complex structural invariants. It is so rich, in
        fact, that well-typed programs are often bug-free.</p>

      <h4 id="prolog">Prolog</h4>
      <p>Though niche in application, logic programming is an alternate paradigm for computational thinking.</p>
      <p>It's worth understanding logic programming for those instances where a programmer may need to emulate it within
        another paradigm.</p>
      <p>Another logic language worth learning is <a class="btn" href="http://minikanren.org/">miniKanren</a>. miniKanren stresses
        pure (cut not allowed) logic programming. This constraint has evolved an alternate style of logic programming
        called relational programming, and it grants properties not typically enjoyed by Prolog programs.</p>

      <h4 id="scala">Scala</h4>
      <p>Scala is a well-designed fusion of functional and object-oriented programming languages. Scala is what Java
        should have been.</p>
      <p>Built atop the Java Virtual Machine, it is compatible with existing Java codebases, and as such, it stands out
        as the most likely successor to Java.</p>

      <h2 id="datastructuresandalgorithms">Data structures and algorithms</h2>
      <p>Students should certainly see the common (or rare yet unreasonably effective) data structures and algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>But, more important than knowing a specific algorithm or data structure (which is usually easy enough to look
        up), computer scientists must understand how to design algorithms (e.g., greedy, dynamic strategies) and how to
        span the gap between an algorithm in the ideal and the nitty-gritty of its implementation.</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-5">Specific recommendations</h3>
      <p>At a minimum, computer scientists seeking stable long-run employment should know all of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>hash tables;</li>
        <li>linked lists;</li>
        <li>trees;</li>
        <li>binary search trees; and</li>
        <li>directed and undirected graphs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Computer scientists should be ready to implement or extend an algorithm that operates on these data structures,
        including the ability to search for an element, to add an element and to remove an element.</p>
      <p>For completeness, computer scientists should know both the imperative and functional versions of each
        algorithm.</p>

      <h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
      <p>A grasp of theory is a prerequisite to research in graduate school.</p>
      <p>Theory is invaluable when it provides hard boundaries on a problem (or when it provides a means of
        circumventing what initially appear to be hard boundaries).</p>
      <p>Computational complexity can legitimately claim to be one of the few truly predictive theories in all of
        computer "science."</p>
      <p>A computer scientist <em>must</em> know where the boundaries of tractability and computability lie. To ignore
        these limits invites frustration in the best case, and failure in the worst.</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-6">Specific recommendations</h3>
      <p>At the undergraduate level, theory should cover at least models of computation and computational complexity.
      </p>
      <p>Models of computation should cover finite-state automata, regular languages (and regular expressions), pushdown
        automata, context-free languages, formal grammars, Turing machines, the lambda calculus, and undecidability.</p>
      <p>At the undergraduate level, students should learn at least enough complexity to understand the difference
        between P, NP, NP-Hard and NP-Complete.</p>
      <p>To avoid leaving the wrong impression, students should solve a few large problems in NP by reduction to SAT and
        the use of modern SAT solvers.</p>

        context-switching, filesystems and internal resource management.</p>
      <p>A good understanding of operating systems is secondary only to an understanding of compilers and architecture
        for achieving performance.</p>

      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-8">Specific recommendations</h3>
      <p>It's important for students to get their hands dirty on a real operating system. With Linux and virtualization,
        this is easier than ever before.</p>

      <h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
      <p>Given the ubiquity of networks, computer scientists should have a firm understanding of the network stack and
        routing protocols within a network.</p>
      <p>The mechanics of building an efficient, reliable transmission protocol (like TCP) on top of an unreliable
        transmission protocol (like IP) should not be magic to a computer scientist. It should be core knowledge.</p>
      <p>Computer scientists must understand the trade-offs involved in protocol design--for example, when to choose TCP
        and when to choose UDP. (Programmers need to understand the larger social implications for congestion should
        they use UDP at large scales as well.)</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-9">Specific recommendations</h3>
      <p>Given the frequency with which the modern programmer encounters network programming, it's helpful to know the
        protocols for existing standards, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>802.3 and 802.11;</li>
        <li>IPv4 and IPv6; and</li>
        <li>DNS, SMTP and HTTP.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Computer scientists should understand exponential back off in packet collision resolution and the
        additive-increase multiplicative-decrease mechanism involved in congestion control.</p>
      <p>Every computer scientist should implement the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an HTTP client and daemon;</li>
        <li>a DNS resolver and server; and</li>
        <li>a command-line SMTP mailer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No student should ever pass an intro neworking class without sniffing their instructor's Google query off <a
          href="http://www.wireshark.org/">wireshark</a>.</p>
      <p>It's probably going too far to require all students to implement a reliable transmission protocol from scratch
        atop IP, but I can say that it was a personally transformative experience for me as a student.</p>

      <p>Computer scientists must be aware of the means by which a program can be compromised.</p>
      <p>They need to develop a sense of defensive programming--a mind for thinking about how their own code might be
        attacked.</p>
      <p>Security is the kind of training that is best distributed throughout the entire curriculum: each discipline
        should warn students of its native vulnerabilities.</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-10">Specific recommendations</h3>

      <p>Cryptography is what makes much of our digital lives possible.</p>

        pitfalls in doing so:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>symmetric-key cryptosystems;</li>
        <li>public-key cryptosystems;</li>

        <li>digital signature algorithms; and</li>
        <li>threshold cryptosystems.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since it's a common fault in implementations of cryptosystems, every computer scientist should know how to
        acquire a <em>sufficiently</em> random number for the task at hand.</p>
      <p>At the very least, as nearly every data breach has shown, computer scientists need to know how to salt and hash
        passwords for storage.</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-11">Specific recommendations</h3>
      <p>Every computer scientist should have the pleasure of breaking ciphertext using pre-modern cryptosystems with

      <p>Every student should create their own digital certificate and set up https in apache. (It's surprisingly
        arduous to do this.)</p>
      <p>Student should also write a console web client that connects over SSL.</p>

      <h2 id="userexperiencedesign">User experience design</h2>
      <p>Programmers too often write software for other programmers, or worse, for themselves.</p>
      <p>User interface design (or more broadly, user experience design) might be the most underappreciated aspect of
        computer science.</p>
      <p>There's a misconception, even among professors, that user experience is a "soft" skill that can't be taught.
      </p>
      <p>In reality, modern user experience design is anchored in empirically-wrought principles from human factors
        engineering and industrial design.</p>
      <p>If nothing else, computer scientists should know that interfaces need to make the ease of executing any task
        proportional to the frequency of the task multiplied by its importance.</p>

      <p>The unfortunate truth is that harnessing parallelism requires deep knowledge of architecture: multicore,
        caches, buses, GPUs, etc.</p>
      <p>And, practice. Lots of practice.</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-12">Specific recommendations</h3>
      <p>It is not at all clear what the "final" answer on parallel programming is, but a few domain-specific solutions
        have emerged.</p>
      <p>For now, students should learn CUDA and OpenCL.</p>
      <p>Threads are a flimsy abstraction for parallelism, particularly when caches and cache coherency are involved.
        But, threads are popular and tricky, so worth learning. Pthreads is a reasonably portable threads library to
        learn.</p>
      <p>For anyone interested in large-scale parallelism, MPI is a prerequisite.</p>
      <p>On the principles side, it does seem that map-reduce is enduring.</p>
      <h2 id="softwareengineering">Software engineering</h2>
      <p>The principles in software engineering change about as fast as the programming languages do.</p>
      <p>A good, hands-on course in the practice of team software construction provides a working knowledge of the
        pitfalls inherent in the endeavor.</p>
      <p>It's been recommended by several readers that students break up into teams of three, with the role of leader
        rotating through three different projects.</p>
      <p>Learning how to attack and maneuver through a large existing codebase is a skill most programmers will have to
        master, and it's one best learned in school instead of on the job.</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-13">Specific recommendations</h3>

      <p>As the demands on secure, reliable software increase, formal methods may one day end up as the only means for
        delivering it.</p>
      <p>At present, formal modeling and verification of software remains challenging, but progress in the field is
        steady: it gets easier every year.</p>
      <p>There may even come a day within the lifetime of today's computer science majors where formal software
        construction is an expected skill.</p>
      <p>Every computer scientist should be at least moderately comfortable using one theorem prover. (I don't think it
        matters which one.)</p>
      <p>Learning to use a theorem prover immediately impacts coding style.</p>
      <p>For example, one feels instinctively allergic to writing a  <code class="language-javascript">match</code> or  <code class="language-javascript">switch</code> statement
        that doesn't cover all possibilities.</p>
      <p>And, when writing recursive functions, users of theorem provers have a strong urge to eliminate
        ill-foundedness.</p>
      <h2 id="graphicsandsimulation">Graphics and simulation</h2>
      <p>There is no discipline more dominated by "clever" than graphics.</p>

      <p>As such, there is no better way to teach clever programming or a solid appreciation of optimizing effort than
        graphics and simulation.</p>
      <p>Over half of the coding hacks I've learned came from my study of graphics.</p>
      <h3 id="specificrecommendations-14">Specific recommendations</h3>
      <p>Simple ray tracers can be constructed in under 100 lines of code.</p>
      <p>It's good mental hygiene to work out the transformations necessary to perform a perspective 3D projection in a
        wireframe 3D engine.</p>

        robotics revolution.</p>
      <p>For those that can program, unimaginable degrees of personal physical automation are on the horizon.</p>
      <h2 id="artificialintelligence">Artificial intelligence</h2>
      <p>If for no other reason than its outsized impact on the early history of computing, computer scientists should
        study artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>While the original dream of intelligent machines seems far off, artificial intelligence spurred a number of
        practical fields, such as machine learning, data mining and natural language processing.</p>
      <h2 id="machinelearning">Machine learning</h2>
      <p>Aside from its outstanding technical merits, the sheer number of job openings for "relevance engineer,"
        indicates that every computer scientist should grasp the fundamentals of machine learning.</p>
      <p>Machine learning doubly emphasizes the need for an understanding of probability and statistics.</p>
      <h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>
      <p>Databases are too common and too useful to ignore.</p>
      <p>It's useful to understand the fundamental data structures and algorithms that power a database engine, since
        programmers often enough reimplement a database system within a larger software system.</p>
      <p>Relational algebra and relational calculus stand out as exceptional success stories in sub-Turing models of
        computation.</p>
      <p>Unlike UML modeling, ER modeling seems to be a reasonable mechanism for visualing encoding the design of and
        constraints upon a software artifact.</p>
