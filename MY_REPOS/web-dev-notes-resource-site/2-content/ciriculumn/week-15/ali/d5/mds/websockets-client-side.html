<p>WebSockets enable two-way communication between the user’s browser (the client) and a server. Normally, the server only responds to client requests. When using WebSockets, once the client has opened a connection with the server, the server can send messages to the client.</p>
<p>A good place to start learning about Websockets on the Web is with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications">Writing WebSocket client applications</a> article on MDN web docs.</p>
<p>After reading this article, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the WebSockets API to create a new WebSocket connection to a server;</li>
<li>Create a WebSocket <code>onopen</code> event handler function to detect when the connection has been opened;</li>
<li>Create a WebSocket <code>onmessage</code> event handler function to detect and process messages sent by the server;</li>
<li>Create a WebSocket <code>onerror</code> event handler function to detect when an error has occurred;</li>
<li>Use the WebSocket <code>send()</code> method to send messages to the server;</li>
<li>Recall that WebSocket message data can be sent as JSON formatted string;</li>
<li>Recall that WebSocket messages usually have a “type" associated with them so the client can determine how to process
    them;</li>
<li>Use the WebSocket <code>close()</code> method to close the connection to the server; and</li>
<li>Create a WebSocket <code>onclose</code> event handler function to detect when the connection to the server has been closed.</li>
</ul>
