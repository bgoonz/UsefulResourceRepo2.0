<!-- @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=2 depthTo=6 orderedList=false} -->
<hr />
<p>Next week, you get a full week to write a compelling front-end application to go into your portfolio.</p>
<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>The following is the list of expectations that must be met for a project to be considered complete.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Project will be picked from the list of projects from the previous reading or come up with your own idea.</li>
<li>You should have the following documentation either in the Wiki of your GitHub repo <em>or</em> in a documentation folder in your root directory:
<ul>
<li>Schema</li>
<li>Feature Document outlining MVP features as well as additional features (user stories and acceptance criteria <em>strongly</em> encouraged)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A README with instructions on how to launch the application</li>
<li>Your app must have user authentication
<ul>
<li>Sign Up</li>
<li>Login / Logout</li>
<li>Demo User Login</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Must have at least one major CRUD feature in addition to user authentication</li>
<li>Front-end:
<ul>
<li>React</li>
<li>Redux</li>
<li>Hooks are optional (but encouraged)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Backend:
<ul>
<li>Express</li>
<li>Sequelize</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="student-responsibilities">Student Responsibilities</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>By EOD today, create your project repo, upload your feature list to your repo and send your project advisor your list of features for sign-off</li>
<li>Join your new “circle" slack which you will be invited to by the end of day. Your circle consists of all the
    students that have the same project advisor as you. You will be having stand up and end of day chats with this
    circle.</li>
<li>Every day you will attend stand up with your advisor and the other students in your circle – be prepared to discuss what you worked on the day before and have a plan for what you want to accomplish that day.</li>
<li>Complete all nightly reports as per usual and use these reports to reflect on your progress. We rely on these reports to check in on your progress so please, as always, take them seriously. Some examples:
<ul>
<li>“I expected to finish the back- and frontend for logging in, but still need to debug my onSubmit."</li>
<li>“At the beginning of the day, I was very confused about the Redux cycle, but going through debugger waterfalls while
    testing my action creators on the window really helped."</li>
<li>“Today I really struggled with destructuring my state. I think the next time I do a project like this, I will
    structure my frontend state to use more slices and less nesting."</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="question-asking">Question Asking</h2>
<p>During this project, you will get practice expressing yourself when running into trouble without just saying “it doesn’t work". In a professional environment, knowing when to ask for help and not spending too much time on any one problem is critical, but making the most out of the time with your manager or Senior Engineers is also vital.</p>
<p>Questions should be asked in Slack to your entire circle. Before asking a question, please have the following available:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you are working on</li>
<li>A description of the problem</li>
<li>What the error message says on the server/frontend console (if there is one)</li>
<li>A relevant code snippet</li>
<li>The debugging process you’ve done so far (MANDATORY)</li>
</ul>
<p>This process allows your fellow students to also help you out – further, it will allow us to know if multiple students are having similar issues and if so we can have a group session to clarify if necessary.</p>
