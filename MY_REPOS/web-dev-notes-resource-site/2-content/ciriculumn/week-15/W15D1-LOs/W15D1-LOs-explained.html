<ol type="1">
<li>Describe the Redux data cycle</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Redux is a node package that facilitates a particular implementation of Flux, which itself is simply a pattern to follow to implement a unidirectional flow of data in our front-end applications.</li>
<li>The Redux adaptation of Flux can be seen in the following gif: <img src="./redux.gif" alt="redux-cycle" /></li>
<li>If we start at the view, ie what the user sees and interacts with, we can describe the cycle as follows.</li>
<li>An event is fired, such as a component mounting, or a user clicking on a button.</li>
<li>There are two major scenarios that result from this event.
<ol type="1">
<li>If our application knows everything that it needs to reflect the change in our store, we can create an action and dispatch it. An example would be a change to the UI, such as showing a form. We don’t need any outside information, we are simply updating our store to indicate that a form should now be displayed.</li>
<li>If our application needs to perform additional outside functions, such as posting or fetching information to/from a database, we dispatch a function, which will be intercepted and invoked before it hits our reducers. The function will ultimately get its data and then dispatch its own action with any additional data that it needed.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>An action is dispatched to the reducers. An action is a POJO that at a minimum has a <code>type</code> key, but can also have additional data associated with it that is necessary to invoke a specific desired change in our store.
<ul>
<li>For example, logging out a user may not need any additional information, since we are simply removing information from our store that we already know the location of.</li>
<li>Adding a new pokemon in a pokedex application, however, would require us to have the information about the pokemon in the action object so that we can add this data to our store.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The action is sent to our reducers. The reducers look at the <code>type</code> key and see if they need to respond to this particular action. If they do, they return a new object that represents their updated state. It’s possible that only one reducer responds to a particular action <code>type</code> or that several reducers will need to respond to it, updating their ‘slice’ of state. This difference does not matter to us because every action will hit every reducer, with reducers that are not impacted by the action simply returning their previous state.</li>
<li>Redux is a separate tool from React. As you’ve seen from lectures and projects, we do not need to implement React in order to take advantage of a Redux store. With that in mind, Redux does play very nicely with React. After the action has hit all of our reducers and our state has been updated, the new state is passed along to each connected component, as we will see in future lessons. If the slice of state that that component was concerned with has changed, the props being passed in to the component will change. As we know from basic React, a change in props will result in a rerendering of the component, which will ultimately reflect any changes that our initial event triggered.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Describe the role of the store in the Redux architecture</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The store holds the global state of an application.</li>
<li>It provides a central location where data can be accessed.</li>
<li>We interact with the store by dispatching actions, which are processed by our reducer to update the state of our store (see next LOs for details).</li>
<li>We can subscribe functions to be invoked whenever an action is dispatched.</li>
<li>We can view the content of our store’s current state with a call to <code>getState</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Explain what a reducer is</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A reducer is a function that is called each time an action is dispatched. The reducer receives an action and the current state as arguments and returns an updated state.</li>
<li>Redux reducers are required to be pure functions of the dispatched action and the current state. This makes their behavior very predictable and allows their effects to potentially be reversed.</li>
<li>A typical reducer has a switch statement with a case for each action <code>type</code> that will modify its slice of state, as well as a default case. For cases that modify, the reducer returns a new object that reflects the result of the action, it does not mutate the original object. For actions that the reducer is not concerned with, the default case simply returns the previous state.</li>
</ul>

<li>Use the <code>createStore</code> method to create an instance of a Redux store</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The <code>createStore</code> function is imported from the <code>redux</code> library.</li>
<li>It must take in a reducer as its first argument, with optional arguments for a preloaded state and enhancers.</li>
<li>The preloaded state argument can set a default value for our store to be created with (we’ll see this can be helpful when restoring data from a session on reload, for example)</li>
<li>Enhancers are middleware functions that we’d like to run with each dispatched action. These are separate from subscribed functions. Where subscribed functions are only invoked after an action has been dispatched and the store has been interacted with, enhancers can interact with the action and store both before and after the store is updated. We often see enhancers used for functionality such as logging the action that was dispatched and how the store was impacted before and after. Another use case would be for middleware that we want to be able to interact with or mutate an action before it hits our reducers, such as thunk middleware.</li>

<li>Dispatching an action means we are going to be sending an object to our reducer in order to impact our store in some way.</li>
<li>The action that we dispatch should have a <code>type</code> key so that our reducer’s switch statement can determine if/how it needs to interact with the object.</li>

<li>Describe why it’s important for a reducer to avoid mutating the current state when creating the next state</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It’s important for us to return a new object in our reducers instead of mutating our state.</li>
<li>We want our reducers to be pure functions, taking in arguments and returning a value in a predictable way without making any kind of outside impact.</li>
<li>The fact that we are returning new objects becomes very important for future applications, as well. In addition to making sure we aren’t inadvertantly changing other aspects of our state, the ability to compare our previous store’s state to the new state that we are returning will be beneficial in determining exactly which slices of state have changed due to our action.</li>
<li>This is especially useful when we connect to React later on, allowing us to easily see which components need to receive this new data.</li>
<li>We return a new object when an action modifies our slice of state so that <code>react-redux</code> knows a change has occurred and can trigger a new mapping of the store’s state to props that are concerned with it. If we were to modify the state object itself, it would assume since the new slice of state has the same object id as the old slice of state that no changes have occurred and will not remap and rerender. This ensuring that state is immutable is part of the optimization that makes the diffing algorithms so fast.</li>

<li>Using constants instead of typing out our strings for an action’s <code>type</code> can be helpful in preventing typos.</li>
<li>This is particularly useful based on the structure of our reducers. If we have a typo in our action’s <code>type</code> we won’t receive an error.
