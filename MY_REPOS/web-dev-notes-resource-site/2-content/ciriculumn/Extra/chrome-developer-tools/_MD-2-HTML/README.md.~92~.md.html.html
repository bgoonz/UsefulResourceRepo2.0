React Router Apple Nav - Stretch Assignment
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Lets build out a navigation app that mimics <code>Apple’s Slick Navigation</code> from their marketing website. At this point you have all the knowledge you’ll need to be able to complete this stretch assignment.
</li>
</ul>

<li>
[ ] Now that you have played around with Routing and have been building out some nested routes etc. It’s time to get you into a little more practice. Remember that repetition is key.
</li>
<li>
[ ] The idea here is to build out a replica of Apple’s navigation.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Build out a menu similar to the one on https://www.apple.com with a top level navigation.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
[ ] Use <em>create-react-app</em> to make an application, name it <code>apple-nav</code>.
</li>
<li>
[ ] You’ll need to build out a few components here. Some variation of a <code>NavWrapper</code> component which will be your navigation header.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Lastly you’re going to need some sort of <code>SubNav</code> component, that will be reusable and display your sub-navigation links for each category.
</li>
</ul>

[ ] Once you are finished with the Navigation and SubNavigation components you’ll be able to look into ways to extend this application by adding some smooth transitions. Look into <a href="https://hackernoon.com/animated-page-transitions-with-react-router-4-reacttransitiongroup-and-animated-1ca17bd97a1a">this article</a> for an example of how this can be achieved.

This example shows the sub-navigation for the <code>/mac</code> route.
