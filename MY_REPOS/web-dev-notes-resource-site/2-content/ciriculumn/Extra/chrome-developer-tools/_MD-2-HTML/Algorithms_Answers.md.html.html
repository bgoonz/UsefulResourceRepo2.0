Exercise I
</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
O(n) because n is the difference between the powers n^2 (worth of each step) and n^3 (max)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
O(n^2) because there are two nested loops
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
O(n) because it is recursive
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exercise-ii">
Exercise II
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
loop through 0 to n-1 to represent each story
</li>
<li>
you will not actually loop through every story, only up to where the eggs start breaking
</li>
<li>
try to drop an egg off of each floor
</li>
<li>
if it is successful (no breakage), go to next floor
</li>
<li>
if egg breaks, save current story as variable and exit loop
</li>
<li>
subtract 1 from current story
</li>
<li>
return story
</li>
<li>
<p>
The runtime of this would be O(n) because there is one loop and it is dependent on the number of building stories.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Alternatively, you could do a binary search, start at n/2 and then do upper or lower half depending on if it breaks or not until you get the max floor.
</li>
<li>
<p>
This would be runtime O(log n).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
