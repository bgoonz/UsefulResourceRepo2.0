Build Week Project: Multi-Page Marketing Website
</h2>
<p>
This project was developed using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and LESS with several parametric mixins and nested styles, different media queries for phone, tablet, and desktop, responsive units for font sizing, and media queries escaped. It has three different animations, coming in from left, right, and bottom. It also has a fourth animation for the checkmarks using SVG.
