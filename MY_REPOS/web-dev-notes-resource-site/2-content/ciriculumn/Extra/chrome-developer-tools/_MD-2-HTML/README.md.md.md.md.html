<p>School in the Cloud is a platform that trains senior volunteers to teach students in a group or individual setting. This helps kids in communities with high student to teacher ratios. It also provides retired volunteers a sense of purpose and meaning in their day to day life when they find themselves with more free time. The platform also connects volunteers with the students. The aim is to help close the achievement gap by connecting students with available, qualified volunteer mentors. The first piece of this app will be creating the three main user types, and allowing an admin to create a training checklist for new volunteers.</p>
<h2 id="mvp">MVP</h2>
<ul>
<li>Onboarding for three user types: Admin, Student, and Volunteer. Each user type will have their own view.</li>
<li>Ability for an admin to create and edit a training “to do list” volunteers to complete. Saving a to do list will make it appear on the volunteers homepage.</li>
<li>Homepage for volunteer to view their to do list from an admin.</li>
<li>Homepage for students to see the profiles of all registered volunteers. They can search by their listed availability times, or their country.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stretch">STRETCH</h2>
<p>ability for volunteer to check off items in their to do list, and progress is reported back to the admin. Ability for a student to schedule a time to meet with a volunteer (see the github for previous flextogether project which worked on scheduling ability). https://github.com/lbw-flextogether</p>
