Preprocessing I: Digital Resume
</h1>
<p>
For this project you will be building a digital resume from scratch. You will be required to use specific preprocessing skills to accomplish your tasks.
</p>
<h2 id="task-1-set-up-the-project-with-git">
Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Add your project manager as collaborator on Github.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda’s by mistake!).
</li>
<li>
[ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Implement the project on your newly created <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code> branch, committing changes regularly.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Push commits: git push origin <code>&lt;firstName-lastName&gt;</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Follow these steps for completing your project.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student’s Repo). <strong>Please don’t merge your own pull request</strong>
</li>
<li>
[ ] Add your project manager as a reviewer on the pull-request
</li>
<li>
[ ] Your project manager will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-2-set-up-your-preprocessor">
Task 2: Set up your preprocessor
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running <code>lessc -v</code> in your terminal, if you don’t get a version message back, reach out to your project manager for help.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Open your terminal and navigate to your preprocessing project by using the <code>cd</code> command
</li>
<li>
[ ] Once in your project’s root folder, run the following command <code>less-watch-compiler less css index.less</code>
</li>
<li>
[ ] Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the <code>background-color</code> on the <code>html</code> selector to <code>red</code>
</li>
<li>
[ ] Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you’re ready to start on the next task
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-3-project-objectives">
Task 3: Project Objectives
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Review the <a href="resume-example.png">example resume</a>. Notice how simplistic the example resume is. Develop a simple layout of your choosing. If you are struggling to be creative, you may use the example resume as your design file. <strong>Note: you are only required to build one page, anything more than that would be stretch.</strong>
</li>
<li>
[ ] The resume content will be provided by you. The content can be about you or a fictional character.<br />
</li>
<li>
[ ] Content: Navigation - Build a simple navigation with 4 items of your choosing
</li>
<li>
[ ] Content: Intro - Have a short introduction as to why you would be a good hire
</li>
<li>
[ ] Content: Skills - Showcase a list of skills you have somewhere on your resume
</li>
<li>
[ ] Content: Work History - Showcase your work history somewhere on your resume
</li>
<li>
[ ] Content: Contact - Provide some way a potential employer could contact you. Phone number, email, or a full on contact form (doesn’t have to work)
</li>
<li>
[ ] Variables: Incorporate variables in your project for color and font stacks.<br />
</li>
<li>
[ ] Nesting: Every selector should be nested inside the main container. Avoid having global styles unless they are element level.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Mixins: Create 2 mixins of your choosing. Hint: It’s super helpful to use flexbox properties in mixins
</li>
<li>
[ ] Mobile: Use nested-at rules to provide a mobile version of your resume. Use <code>500px</code> as a <code>max-width</code> for mobile.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stretch-goals">
Stretch Goals:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Incorporate a google font of your choosing
</li>
<li>
[ ] Convert the great idea CSS into LESS. Introduce variables, mixins, nesting, etc.
</li>
<li>
[ ] Create a link to the portfolio page and create a layout that would allow users to see your work. A good idea is to link projects back to their github repos so employers can see your code.
</li>
</ul>
