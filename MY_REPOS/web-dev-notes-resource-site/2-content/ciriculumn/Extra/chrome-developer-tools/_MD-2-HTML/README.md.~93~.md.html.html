Instructions
</h2>
<p>
<strong>NOTE ⚠️ - You will NOT need to finish this project after React Router I. Start working on it now, then you can finish it up after the next module - React Router II.</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
[X] <strong>Fork</strong> this repository, then clone your fork.
</li>
<li>
[X] <strong>NOTE</strong> You have 2 servers that you will be running here so read these instructions carefully.
</li>
<li>
[X] <strong>In the root of this directory</strong>: Run <code>yarn install</code> to download dependencies.
</li>
<li>
[X] Run the server using <code>yarn start</code> or <code>node server.js</code>. (Don’t worry too much about this process, you’ll get used to doing this and it will be explained more in the future).
</li>
<li>
[X] In a separate terminal cd into the <code>client</code> folder and run <code>yarn install</code> to download dependencies.
</li>
<li>
<p>
[X] Still inside the <code>client</code> folder run <code>yarn start</code> to run the client application.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
[X] Once your application is up and running on the client, you should see a browser window that looks like this at <code>localhost:3000</code> <img src="https://ibin.co/3xhmmHVl9BKF.png" alt="Movies Home" />
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-1">
Part 1:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
[X] Wrap your app with the router.
</li>
<li>
[X] Inside your App file add two routes.
</li>
<li>
[X] one route for <code>/</code> that loads the <code>MovieList</code> component.
</li>
<li>
[X] one route that will take an <code>id</code> parameter after<code>/movies/</code> (ex: <code>/movies/2</code>, <code>/movies/3</code> where the id is dynamic). This route should load the <code>Movie</code> component.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-2">
Part 2:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
[X] Make it so that the card in <code>MovieList</code> is a link, this should direct the user to the <code>/movies/{id of movie here}</code> URL, where <code>:id</code> is the id of the individual movie.
</li>
<li>
[X] When a user clicks on a movie card they should be taken to <code>/movies/{id of movie here}</code> to see the details for the selected movie.
</li>
<li>
[X] You will need to modify line 13 of <code>Movie.js</code> in order to accept the correct id for the movie selected.
</li>
<li>
[X] Add functionality so the <code>Home</code> button on the <code>SavedList</code> component navigates back to home.
</li>
<li>
[X] You should now be able to navigate back and forth between the individual movies and the home screen.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stretch-goals.">
Stretch Goals.
</h2>
<p>
If you have completed Parts 1 &amp; 2 feel free to move on to these stretch goals.
</p>
<h3 id="refactor-so-that-our-code-is-dry.">
Refactor so that our code is DRY.
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
[X] You may notice that we are using essentially the same exact JSX code in the <code>Movie</code> component and the <code>MovieDetails</code> component in <code>MovieList.js</code> create a new component in <code>MovieCard.js</code> that returns this JSX code. Then remove the old code from <code>Movie</code> and <code>MovieDetails</code> and instead return the new <code>MovieCard</code> component.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="add-save-movie-functionality.">
Add <code>Save Movie</code> functionality.
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] You will notice there is a ‘Saved Movies’ component that we are not currently using. In this step you will add the functionality to save a movie. You will need to pass the <code>addToSavedList</code> function to the <code>Movie</code> component. Once you have done that you will need to add a click handler to the save button. You will need to uncomment lines 24-27 in <code>Movie.js</code> to complete this.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="turn-your-saved-movie-list-into-links.">
Turn your Saved Movie list into <code>Link</code>s.
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Your list of saved movies should be links to the movie itself. Study and understand what the <code>saveMovie</code> function is doing.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="turn-your-saved-movie-links-into-navlinks.">
Turn your Saved Movie <code>Link</code>s into <code>NavLink</code>s.
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
[ ] Navlink
</li>
</ul>
