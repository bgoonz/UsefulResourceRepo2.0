<h2 id="arrays">Arrays</h2>
<p>What is an array and how do they work?</p>
<ul>
<li>They have a fixed length/size<br />
</li>
<li>A sequence of contiguous objects of the same type, storing data<br />
</li>
<li>Index based with a value<br />
</li>
<li>Time and Space efficient<br />
</li>
<li>Fast at inserting to the end, slow at inserting to the beginning (because all objects in the array are shifted one space to the right if there is available space OR a new copy of the array is made if there is no available space)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>01 01 was a race horse<br />
10 10 was one too<br />
01 01 won one race<br />
10 10 01 01 10</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br> An array allocates a certain amount of memory when they are created.</p>
<p>Array lookup begins at <code>[0]</code> because it’s zero pointer sizes away from the pointer at the beginning of the sequence. While it’s harder for people, it’s easier for computers to do the math.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Index * size of type = array[index]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, 0 * 4 bits = 0. If we started with 1 instead of 0, that would require an additional operation to find the starting point beause 1 * 4 = 4, not 0.</p>
<p>array[5] would point to the 20th bit because 5 * 4 = 20.</p>
<p>If we know that we want an array of 3, 12 bits of memory will be set aside for this array (3 * 4 = 12).</p>
<p>If we want to decrease the size of that array, we can easily indicate that the memory for that array is <em>less</em> than 12 bits.</p>
<p>But if we want to <em>add</em> to the array, we have to first check <em>if</em> the memory next to the end of the current array is already allocated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If that memory is not already allocated, we can use it to expand the array. But if it is taken, how do we expand the array?</p>
<p>Because arrays must be contiguous (unlike linked lists), we can’t just allocate the next closest available bits of memory.</p>
<p>Depending on if the language manages memory for us (like Python), we may have to do this manually.</p>
<p>We first would need to find a larger memory block that fits the new array length, then copy the original array data into that new memory block. Afterwards, we release the original block of memory by marking it as free (or able to be collected by the garbage collector).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Typically that data is not actually cleared. It’s just marked as free to re-use. When we get rid of old hard drives or other memory storage devices, it’s best to fully destroy anything that contained sensitive data because it may still be written to memory if it was not memory that was cleared to re-use. De-allocation is not the same as erasing, despite being “deleted” according to the computer.</p>
<p>Not all languages de-allocate automatically. In Python it does, but in C, you have to do it manually (or risk a memory leak).</p>

<h2 id="lifofilo">LIFO/FILO</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>LIFO = Last In First Out<br />
FILO = First In Last Out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can think of stacks like vertical stacks of paper on a desk. We add to the top of the stack, placing newer papers on top. As we process through the papers, we’re dealing with the newer papers first, instead of the oldest.</p>
<p>You can also think of LIFO/FILO with your email inbox. Most people work through their email inbox from the top down (newest to oldest). Or, a social medai feed. The most recent thing would be considered the most important.</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<h2 id="queue">Queue</h2>
<p><a href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/recMcvOrFw5BWUku3">TK: Queues</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>FIFO = First In First Out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most stores work with a first in, first served method to ensure that customers are happy and served quickly. Similarly, a bakery wants to sell the older baked good sooner than the brand new ones. First made, first sold. If you add the new ones to the front, then the old ones might go bad (expire).</p>
<p>If a customer service line handled new inqueries first, the first customers to reach out would become very angry. Or a playlist usually lists the oldest song put onto the playlist first.</p>
<p>Queues function the same way where they handle the oldest items first.</p>

<h2 id="linked-lists">Linked Lists</h2>
<p><a href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/cs/module/rec3MaMAY78iDm7ax">TK: Linked Lists</a></p>
<p>Lists are used for remembering things and checking them off in order, like a grocery list.</p>
<p>Linked Lists and Arrays are very similar - both are used for storing lists of data. Arrays are usually included as part of any language’s library but linked lists are not necessarily (JS and Python do not export a standard linked list implementation), so we are more familiar with arrays. We see them commonly.</p>
<p>With arrays, the information stored within them are all physically stored next to each other in memory.</p>
<p>A linked list might be better represented as a bead necklace - little nodes connected by a link (beads by string). There is no requirement that this data exist next to each other in memory. Instead, each item in the list points to the next item’s location in memory.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Array_LList.png" title="Arrays v Linked Lists" alt="Arrays v Linked Lists" /><figcaption>Arrays v Linked Lists</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Arrays <em>have</em> to be contiguous because they are data stored next to each other in memory. In the bits, the allocated memory must always have a value – it isn’t null in memory. It’s either a 0 or a 1. No matter if we aren’t storing a value, a 0 is still being read. That position in memory is always being read, so even if it’s “empty”, it’ll be <em>read</em> as nothing. (That memory is either still reserved for the array or marked as not in use, but probably contains unused data.)</p>
<p>Linked Lists are <em>not</em> contiguous. The parts can exist in separate blocks of memory, pointing from one to the next.</p>
<p>If we have a grocery list like so:</p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Milk<br />
Ground Beef<br />
Cheese<br />
Taco Shells<br />
Lettuce<br />
Eggs<br />
Salsa</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>We could go down the list and get each item in order. But navigating a grocery store makes more sense if we move through section by section. If we start with Milk, we’re near the dairy. It would make the most sense to get cheese and eggs before getting the other items.</p>
<p>If we then added in Hot Sauce, we know that it’s probably by Taco Shells, so rather than adding it to the end of the list, we would want to add it before or after Taco Shells to organize it better.</p>
<p>With a linked list, each item points to the next item. If we re-wrote our list like a linked list, it would look more like this:</p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Milk<br />
Cheese<br />
Eggs<br />
Ground Beef<br />
Taco Shells<br />
Hot Sauce<br />
Salsa<br />
Lettuce</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>In a linked list, each item is a Node with a pointer to the next item. Milk would point to Cheese. Salsa would point to Lettuce.</p>
<p>When we add Hot Sauce in, previously, Taco Shells pointed to Salsa. In order to add an item, we would find an open space in memory, create a new node called Hot Sauce. Hot Sauce would point to Salsa. Then we would change Taco Shells to point to Hot Sauce.</p>
<p>In this way, updating items in a Linked List is more time and space efficient than with an array, because we aren’t having to find a new contiguous space of memory and copy an old array; or shift all items in the array over one.</p>
<p>With the Linked List, we add a new node and update the previous node’s pointer. It’s quick and easy.</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-each-data-structure">What are the advantages of each data structure?</h2>
<p>If our memory is already being used up by other applications - there are available spots but not that many. If we use an array, we need that specific size of continuous space for that array. A linked list is more memory flexible by using the available spaces.</p>
<p>That said, this con of linked lists is more conceptual than applicable. Typically, arrays are still considered to be more memory efficient and this would not be a factor in choosing a linked list over an array.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good reason to decide which one to use is considering the run time of removing or inserting an item from the linked list v array.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we wanted to remove the first item in an array, there would be a hole in the first spot of the array. Arrays are unhappy if the hole is anywhere other than the end of the array - so the remaining elements are shifted one to the left. The runtime of that change is <code>O(n)</code>. A very large array would have a significant shift run time.</p>
<p>Removing any elements from the front or middle of an array is a linear operation in the worst case (the exception is removing from the end).</p>
<p>If we wanted to insert a new element to the start (or middle) or an array, we have to shift the other elements to the right to make room for a new item to be added into the continuous array space in memory.</p>
<p>Again, insert (other than to the end of an array) has a linear run time <code>O(n)</code>.</p>
<p>Arrays are only efficient when adding/removing from the end.</p>
<p>Linked Lists instead have a basic “head of the list” and “tail of the list”, with references to each.</p>
<pre><code>H -&gt; x -&gt; x -&gt; x -&gt; x -&gt; T</code></pre>
<p>To remove an item from the start of the linked list, we would need to shift the Head Reference to the second item in the linked list (the new Head of the list) and then remove the first node.</p>
<pre><code>H -&gt; x -&gt; x -&gt; x -&gt; T</code></pre>
<p>Nothing is shifted. The pointers to the next item in the list are simply being moved around.</p>
<p>If we wanted to add a new element into the middle of the list, we would simply add a new node, that holds a reference to the previous and next node in the list. Nothing is being shifted, just the pointers are being re-drawn.</p>
<p>No matter how big the linked list is, the run time is constant <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<p>Adding or removing from the end of the linked list retains the same run time as an array too - so it’s more efficient overall and equally efficient to the array’s best case scenario.</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<h2 id="implementing-linked-lists">Implementing Linked Lists</h2>
<p>Typically with linked list implementations, there’s a node class and a linked list class (which builds on top of the node class). Let’s start building one in our <a href="linked_list.py">linked list python file</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<pre><code>class Node:
    def __init__(self, value=None, next_node=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next_node = next_node
</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our Node class starts with a value that defaults to none and a next_node that also defaults to None. We’ll also add some methods:</p>
<p><br></p>
<pre><code>class Node:
    def __init__(self, value=None, next_node=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next_node = next_node
    
    def get_value(self):
        return self.value

    def get_next(self):
        return self.next_node
    
    def set_next(self, new_next):
        self.next_node = new_next

    def set_value(self, value):
        self.value = value</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>This gives our Node some methods that will return the current value, the pointer to the next node and allows us to re-assign the next node pointer.</p>
<p>Our LinkedList needs a Head Reference and Tail Reference - those are the only reference a linked list contains, which is an important difference to arrays. Every item in an array is indexed, allowing us to access any element within the array via bracket notation. Linked Lists do not work the same way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To traverse a linked list, you have to start at the head node and keep moving the reference through the list, until you find the wanted item. We can’t just request and access x item in the list (second or fifth).</p>
<p>This is one of the major reasons arrays are more commonly used because indexing is useful.</p>
<p>We’ll also adds a method to add a tail to the end of our linked list. Thinking about the way that adding a new item to the linked list is by creating a new node, the re-write the previous next_node reference to the new node, and then re-write the Tail Reference to this new node.</p>
<p><br></p>
<pre><code>class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def add_to_tail(self, value):
        # wrap the value in a node
        new_node = Node(value)
        # update the old tail&#39;s next reference to refer to the new node
        self.tail.set_next(new_node)
        # update the linked list&#39;s &#39;tail&#39; reference
        self.tail = new_node
</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>Does the order of those last two operations matter? Why would this work (or not)?</p>
<p><br></p>
<pre><code>    def add_to_tail(self, value):
        # wrap the value in a node
        new_node = Node(value)
        # update the linked list&#39;s &#39;tail&#39; reference
        self.tail = new_node
        # update the old tail&#39;s next reference to refer to the new node
        self.tail.set_next(new_node)</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>If, instead, we made the new node and then moved the Tail Reference to the end prior to setting self.tail.set_next() would mean that it would just be the new node referencing itself, instead of the <em>previous</em> node referencing the new node as the tail.</p>
<p>Order matters for this.</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<h5 id="edge-cases">Edge Cases</h5>
<p>What are some assumptions we’re making currently that don’t account for possible edge cases?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The list was not empty, elements already existed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does an empty Linked List look like?</p>
<p>It just has head and tail references that are both “none”.</p>
<p>If we add a new node, it will be the only node in the linked list and will be referenced to as both the head and the tail.</p>
<p>To adjust our constructor for handling this, we can keep our current setup but we need to also set the head:</p>
<p><br></p>
<pre><code>        # check if we&#39;re in an empty list state
        # can also write: if not self.head and not self.tail
        if self.head == None and self.tail == None:
            # set the list&#39;s head reference to point to new_node
            self.head = new_node

            # set the list&#39;s tail reference to point to new_node
            self.tail = new_node</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now our Linked List class will look like this with the If/Else setup handling this edge case:</p>
<p><br></p>
<pre><code>class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def add_to_tail(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)

        if self.head == None and self.tail == None:
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node

        else:
            self.tail.set_next(new_node)
            self.tail = new_node
</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now let’s add a remove head method. We need to take the old_head’s value, and update it to the next_node, then remove that node.</p>
<p><br></p>
<pre><code>        def remove_head(self):
            # Store reference to node being removed to return value
            old_head = self.head
            # update head reference to refer to the old head&#39;s next_node
            self.head = old_head.get_next()
            # return the old head&#39;s value
            return old_head.get_value()</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>A double linked list would imply that the flow of pointers goes in both directions. Currently, they only go one way, with each node pointing to the next one, but not the previous one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>H -&gt; x -&gt; x -&gt; x -&gt; T</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A linked list where the nodes point to both the previous <em>and</em> next node, then that is a doubly linked list, like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>H &lt;-&gt; x &lt;-&gt; x &lt;-&gt; x &lt;-&gt; T</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hash Tables and Caches are times where linked lists might be preferred over arrays…but that comes later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if our list is empty? We need to return non to show we can’t remove the head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ll check and return <code>None</code> if that is the case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if our list has only one Node?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the <code>self.head</code> will equal s<code>elf.tail</code>, because the head reference and tail reference will be to the same node.</p>
<p>We’ll set our reference to the old_head and then update the current head and tail to None, since removing this single Node would mean there is no node left (empty list)</p>
<p><br></p>
<pre><code>            # what if our list is empty?
            if not self.head and not self.tail:
                return None
            # what if our list only contains a single node?
            if self.head is self.tail:
                old_head = self.head
                self.head = None
                self.tail = None
                return old_head.get_value()</code></pre>
<p><br> <br></p>
<h2 id="iterating-through-a-linked-list">Iterating Through a Linked List</h2>
<p>How can we iterate through a linked list, looking for a target value?</p>
<p>First, let’s check if our list is empty. There’s no reason to search through our list if it contains nothing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<pre><code>    def contains(self, target):
        # what if our list is empty?
        if not self.head and not self.tail:
            return False
        # get the current reference that initially starts at the head of the list
        current = self.head
        # keep looping while curent is valid (not None)
        while current:
            # check if current.get_value() is the same as our target
            if current.get_value() == target:
                return True
            # otherwise, update current to the next node
            else:
                current = current.get_next()
        # otherwise we didn&#39;t find it in the linked list so return false
        return False</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>If our list is like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 –&gt; 2 –&gt; 3 –&gt; 4 –&gt; N</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have to start at the head because with a single Linked List, we can only traverse it in one direction.</p>
<p>Does this linked list contain 3?</p>
<p>We keep looping so long as there is a Node to check against the Target (3).</p>
<p>When it checks Node 1, and 1 != 3, <code>Current</code> become Node 2. It continues to iterate through until it hits Node 3 and returns <code>True</code> because 3 == 3.</p>
<p>If we were looking for 5, this would iterate through the entire linked list until the final Node is <code>None</code> (end of the list) and no target matched, so it returns <code>False</code>.</p>
