    <p>This document describes the steps that you should take to resolve module name disputes with other npm publishers.
        It also describes special steps you should take about names you think infringe your trademarks.</p>
    <p>This document is a clarification of the acceptable behavior outlined in the <a
            href="https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct">npm Code of Conduct</a>, and nothing in this document should
        be interpreted to contradict any aspect of the npm Code of Conduct.</p>
    <h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Get the author email with <code>npm owner ls &lt;pkgname&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Email the author, CC <a href="mailto:support@npmjs.com" class="email">support@npmjs.com</a></li>
        <li>After a few weeks, if there’s no resolution, we’ll sort it out.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Don’t squat on package names. Publish code or move out of the way.</p>
    <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
    <p>There sometimes arise cases where a user publishes a module, and then later, some other user wants to use that
        name. Here are some common ways that happens (each of these is based on actual events.)</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Alice writes a JavaScript module <code>foo</code>, which is not node-specific. Alice doesn’t use node at
            all. Yusuf wants to use <code>foo</code> in node, so he wraps it in an npm module. Some time later, Alice
            starts using node, and wants to take over management of her program.</li>
        <li>Yusuf writes an npm module <code>foo</code>, and publishes it. Perhaps much later, Alice finds a bug in
            <code>foo</code>, and fixes it. She sends a pull request to Yusuf, but Yusuf doesn’t have the time to deal
            with it, because he has a new job and a new baby and is focused on his new Erlang project, and kind of not
            involved with node any more. Alice would like to publish a new <code>foo</code>, but can’t, because the name
            is taken.
        </li>
        <li>Yusuf writes a 10-line flow-control library, and calls it <code>foo</code>, and publishes it to the npm
            registry. Being a simple little thing, it never really has to be updated. Alice works for Foo Inc, the
            makers of the critically acclaimed and widely-marketed <code>foo</code> JavaScript toolkit framework. They
            publish it to npm as <code>foojs</code>, but people are routinely confused when <code>npm install foo</code>
            is some different thing.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Yusuf writes a parser for the widely-known <code>foo</code> file format, because he needs it for work.
                Then, he gets a new job, and never updates the prototype. Later on, Alice writes a much more complete
                <code>foo</code> parser, but can’t publish, because Yusuf’s <code>foo</code> is in the way.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><code>npm owner ls foo</code>. This will tell Alice the email address of the owner (Yusuf).</li>
        <li>Alice emails Yusuf, explaining the situation <strong>as respectfully as possible</strong>, and what she
            would like to do with the module name. She adds the npm support staff <a href="mailto:support@npmjs.com"
                class="email">support@npmjs.com</a> to the CC list of the email. Mention in the email that Yusuf can run
            npm owner <code>add alice foo</code> to add Alice as an owner of the foo package.</li>
        <li>
            <p>After a reasonable amount of time, if Yusuf has not responded, or if Yusuf and Alice can’t come to any
                sort of resolution, email support <a href="mailto:support@npmjs.com" class="email">support@npmjs.com</a>
                and we’ll sort it out. ("Reasonable" is usually at least 4 weeks.)</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h3>
    <p>In almost every case so far, the parties involved have been able to reach an amicable resolution without any
        major intervention. Most people really do want to be reasonable, and are probably not even aware that they’re in
        your way.</p>
    <p>Module ecosystems are most vibrant and powerful when they are as self-directed as possible. If an admin one day
        deletes something you had worked on, then that is going to make most people quite upset, regardless of the
        justification. When humans solve their problems by talking to other humans with respect, everyone has the chance
        to end up feeling good about the interaction.</p>
    <h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
    <p>Some things are not allowed, and will be removed without discussion if they are brought to the attention of the
        npm registry admins, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Malware (that is, a package designed to exploit or harm the machine on which it is installed).</li>
        <li>Violations of copyright or licenses (for example, cloning an MIT-licensed program, and then removing or
            changing the copyright and license statement).</li>
        <li>Illegal content.</li>
        <li>"Squatting" on a package name that you plan to use, but aren’t actually using. Sorry, I don’t care how great
            the name is, or how perfect a fit it is for the thing that someday might happen. If someone wants to use it
            today, and you’re just taking up space with an empty tarball, you’re going to be evicted.</li>
        <li>Putting empty packages in the registry. Packages must have SOME functionality. It can be silly, but it can’t
            be nothing. (See also: squatting.)</li>
        <li>Doing weird things with the registry, like using it as your own personal application database or otherwise
            putting non-packagey things into it.</li>
        <li>Other things forbidden by the npm <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct">Code of Conduct</a> such
            as hateful language, pornographic content, or harassment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you see bad behavior like this, please report it to <a href="mailto:abuse@npmjs.com"
            class="email">abuse@npmjs.com</a> right away. <strong>You are never expected to resolve abusive behavior on
            your own. We are here to help.</strong></p>
    <h3 id="trademarks">Trademarks</h3>
    <p>If you think another npm publisher is infringing your trademark, such as by using a confusingly similar package
        name, email <a href="mailto:abuse@npmjs.com" class="email">abuse@npmjs.com</a> with a link to the package or
        user account on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">https://www.npmjs.com/</a>. Attach a copy of your trademark
        registration certificate.</p>
    <p>If we see that the package’s publisher is intentionally misleading others by misusing your registered mark
        without permission, we will transfer the package name to you. Otherwise, we will contact the package publisher
        and ask them to clear up any confusion with changes to their package’s <code>README</code> file or metadata.</p>
