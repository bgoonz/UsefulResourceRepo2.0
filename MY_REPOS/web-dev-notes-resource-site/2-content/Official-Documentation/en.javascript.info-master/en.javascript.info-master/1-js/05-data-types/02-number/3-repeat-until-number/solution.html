<p>```js run demo function readNumber() { let num;</p>
<p>do { num = prompt(“Enter a number please?”, 0); } while ( !isFinite(num) );</p>
<p>if (num === null || num === ’’) return null;</p>
<p>return +num; }</p>
<p>alert(<code>Read: ${readNumber()}</code>); ```</p>
<p>The solution is a little bit more intricate that it could be because we need to handle <code>null</code>/empty lines.</p>
<p>So we actually accept the input until it is a “regular number”. Both <code>null</code> (cancel) and empty line also fit that condition, because in numeric form they are <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>After we stopped, we need to treat <code>null</code> and empty line specially (return <code>null</code>), because converting them to a number would return <code>0</code>.</p>
