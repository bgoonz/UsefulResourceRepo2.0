<h1 id="code-structure">Code structure</h1>
<p>The first thing we’ll study is the building blocks of code.</p>
<h2 id="statements">Statements</h2>
<p>Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen a statement, <code>alert('Hello, world!')</code>, which shows the message “Hello, world!”.</p>
<p>We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.</p>
<p>For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:</p>
<p><code>js run no-beautify alert('Hello'); alert('World');</code></p>
<p>Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:</p>
<p><code>js run no-beautify alert('Hello'); alert('World');</code></p>
<h2 id="semicolons-semicolon">Semicolons [#semicolon]</h2>
<p>A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.</p>
<p>This would also work:</p>
<p><code>js run no-beautify alert('Hello') alert('World')</code></p>
<p>Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an <a href="https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion">automatic semicolon insertion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!</strong></p>
<p>There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:</p>
<p><code>js run no-beautify alert(3 + 1 + 2);</code></p>
<p>The code outputs <code>6</code> because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus <code>"+"</code>, then it is an “incomplete expression”, so the semicolon is not required. And in this case that works as intended.</p>
<p><strong>But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.</strong></p>
<p>Errors which occur in such cases are quite hard to find and fix.</p>
<p>````smart header=“An example of an error” If you’re curious to see a concrete example of such an error, check this code out:</p>
<p><code>js run [1, 2].forEach(alert)</code></p>
<p>No need to think about the meaning of the brackets <code>[]</code> and <code>forEach</code> yet. We’ll study them later. For now, just remember the result of the code: it shows <code>1</code> then <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s add an <code>alert</code> before the code and <em>not</em> finish it with a semicolon:</p>
<p>```js run no-beautify alert(“There will be an error”)</p>
<p>[1, 2].forEach(alert) ```</p>
<p>Now if we run the code, only the first <code>alert</code> is shown and then we have an error!</p>
<p>But everything is fine again if we add a semicolon after <code>alert</code>: ```js run alert(“All fine now”);</p>
<p>[1, 2].forEach(alert)<br />
```</p>
<p>Now we have the “All fine now” message followed by <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>The error in the no-semicolon variant occurs because JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets <code>[...]</code>.</p>
<p>So, because the semicolon is not auto-inserted, the code in the first example is treated as a single statement. Here’s how the engine sees it:</p>
<p><code>js run no-beautify alert("There will be an error")[1, 2].forEach(alert)</code></p>
<p>But it should be two separate statements, not one. Such a merging in this case is just wrong, hence the error. This can happen in other situations. ````</p>
<p>We recommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines. This rule is widely adopted by the community. Let’s note once again – <em>it is possible</em> to leave out semicolons most of the time. But it’s safer – especially for a beginner – to use them.</p>
<h2 id="comments-code-comments">Comments [#code-comments]</h2>
<p>As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add <em>comments</em> which describe what the code does and why.</p>
<p>Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don’t affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.</p>
<p><strong>One-line comments start with two forward slash characters <code>//</code>.</strong></p>
<p>The rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own or follow a statement.</p>
<p>Like here: ```js run // This comment occupies a line of its own alert(‘Hello’);</p>
<p>alert(‘World’); // This comment follows the statement ```</p>
<p><strong>Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk <code>/*</code> and end with an asterisk and a forward slash <code>*/</code>.</strong></p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p><code>js run /* An example with two messages. This is a multiline comment. */ alert('Hello'); alert('World');</code></p>
<p>The content of comments is ignored, so if we put code inside <code>/* … */</code>, it won’t execute.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code:</p>
<p><code>js run /* Commenting out the code alert('Hello'); */ alert('World');</code></p>
<p><code>smart header="Use hotkeys!" In most editors, a line of code can be commented out by pressing the `key:Ctrl+/` hotkey for a single-line comment and something like `key:Ctrl+Shift+/` -- for multiline comments (select a piece of code and press the hotkey). For Mac, try `key:Cmd` instead of `key:Ctrl` and `key:Option` instead of `key:Shift`.</code></p>
<p>```<code>warn header="Nested comments are not supported!" There may not be</code>/<em>…</em>/<code>inside another</code>/<em>…</em>/`.</p>
<p>Such code will die with an error:</p>
<p><code>js run no-beautify /*   /* nested comment ?!? */ */ alert( 'World' );</code> ````</p>
<p>Please, don’t hesitate to comment your code.</p>
<p>Comments increase the overall code footprint, but that’s not a problem at all. There are many tools which minify code before publishing to a production server. They remove comments, so they don’t appear in the working scripts. Therefore, comments do not have negative effects on production at all.</p>
<p>Later in the tutorial there will be a chapter <a href="info:code-quality" class="uri">info:code-quality</a> that also explains how to write better comments.</p>
