<h3 id="componentwillmount">componentWillMount</h3>
<p><strong>componentWillMount</strong> is executed just before the React Component is about to mount on the DOM. Hence, after this method the component will mount. All the things that you want to do before a component mounts has to be defined here. This method is executed once in a lifecycle of a component and before first render. Usage: <strong>componentWillMount</strong> is used for initializing the states or props, there is a huge debate going on to merge it with the constructor.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-constructor-and-componentwillmount">Difference between constructor and componentWillMount</h2>
<p>Only thing you can’t achieve inside the constructor that you can with ComponentWillMount is to setState(). Also react throws a warning if anything inside your constructor modifies state even in another component.</p>
