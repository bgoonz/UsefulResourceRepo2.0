##Scope
The project for this unit asks the student to create a webpage that includes text, a title, images and links. The students will push their project to GitHub and will finish the unit off with a three question unit challenge.

##Estimated Completion Time
This project should take one 45 minute period to complete. Projects may take more or less time depending on students' needs.  

##Teacher Pro Tips

* Today will be the first day to introduce the students to the daily session doc (bit.ly/ScriptEd). The lead teacher must update the document and have students navigate to the link at the beginning of class.
