### Assembly languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=2)\]

Main article: [Assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)

[Assembly languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) directly correspond to a [machine language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_language) \(see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Machine_languages)\), although there may not be a 1-1 mapping between an individual statement and an individual instruction, so machine code instructions appear in a form understandable by humans. Assembly languages let programmers use symbolic addresses, which the [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language_assembler) converts to absolute or [relocatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_%28computing%29) addresses. Most assemblers also support [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_%28computer_science%29) and [symbolic constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_%28computer_programming%29).

### Authoring languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=3)\]

Main article: [Authoring language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoring_language)

An [authoring language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoring_language) is a programming language desined for use by a non-computer expert to easily create tutorials, websites, and other interactive computer programs.

### Constraint programming languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=4)\]

Main article: [Constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming)

A [constraint programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming_language) is a [declarative programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming_language) where relationships between variables are expressed as [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_%28mathematics%29). Execution proceeds by attempting to find values for the variables which satisfy all declared constraints.

### Concurrent languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=7)\]

Main category: [Concurrent programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Concurrent_programming_languages)For a more comprehensive list, see [List of concurrent and parallel programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_concurrent_and_parallel_programming_languages).

[Message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) languages provide language constructs for [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29). The predominant paradigm for concurrency in mainstream languages such as [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) is [shared memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory) concurrency. Concurrent languages that make use of message passing have generally been inspired by process calculi such as [communicating sequential processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) \(CSP\) or the [π-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus).

**Curly-bracket** or **curly-brace programming languages** have a syntax that defines statement blocks using the [curly bracket or brace characters `{` and `}`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braces_%28punctuation%29). This syntax originated with [BCPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL) \(1966\), and was popularized by [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29). Many curly-bracket languages descend from or are strongly influenced by C. Examples of curly-bracket languages include:

### Data-oriented languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=10)\]

Data-oriented languages provide powerful ways of searching and manipulating the relations that have been described as entity relationship tables which map one set of things into other sets.\[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] Examples of data-oriented languages include:

* [Clarion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_%28programming_language%29)

### Decision table languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=11)\]

[Decision tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_table) can be used as an aid to clarifying the logic before writing a program in any language, but in the 1960s a number of languages were developed where the main logic is expressed directly in the form of a decision table, including:

* [Filetab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filetab)

### Declarative languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=12)\]

Main category: [Declarative programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Declarative_programming_languages)

[Declarative languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) express the logic of a computation without describing its control flow in detail. [Declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) stands in contrast to [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) via imperative programming languages, where control flow is specified by serial orders \(imperatives\). \(Pure\) [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Functional_languages) and [logic-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Logic-based_languages) programming languages are also declarative, and constitute the major subcategories of the declarative category. This section lists additional examples not in those subcategories.

### Embeddable languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=13)\]

#### In source code\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=14)\]

Source embeddable languages embed small pieces of executable code inside a piece of free-form text, often a web page.

Client-side embedded languages are limited by the abilities of the browser or intended client. They aim to provide dynamism to web pages without the need to recontact the server.

Server-side embedded languages are much more flexible, since almost any language can be built into a server. The aim of having fragments of server-side code embedded in a web page is to generate additional markup dynamically; the code itself disappears when the page is served, to be replaced by its output.

**Server side\[edit\]**

* [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)
* [VBScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript)
* SMX – dedicated to web pages
* [Tcl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) – server-side in [NaviServer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaviServer) and an essential component in electronics industry systems
* [WebDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDNA) – dedicated to database-driven websites

The above examples are particularly dedicated to this purpose. A large number of other languages, such as [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29), [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_%28programming_language%29), [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) and [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29) can be adapted \(for instance, by being made into [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server) modules\).

**Client side\[edit\]**

* [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript)
* [JavaScript \(aka ECMAScript or JScript\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
* [VBScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript) \(Windows only\)

#### In object code\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=17)\]

A wide variety of dynamic or scripting languages can be embedded in compiled executable code. Basically, object code for the language's [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29) needs to be linked into the executable. Source code fragments for the embedded language can then be passed to an evaluation function as strings. Application control languages can be implemented this way, if the source code is input by the user. Languages with small interpreters are preferred.

### Functional languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=22)\]

Main category: [Functional languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Functional_languages)

[Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) languages define programs and subroutines as mathematical functions and treat them as first-class. Many so-called functional languages are "impure", containing imperative features. Many functional languages are tied to mathematical calculation tools. Functional languages include:

### Hardware description languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=25)\]

For a more comprehensive list, see [List of hardware description languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hardware_description_languages).

In electronics, a [hardware description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language) \(HDL\) is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure, design, and operation of electronic circuits, and most commonly, digital logic circuits. The two most widely used and well-supported HDL varieties used in industry are [Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog) and [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL). Hardware description languages include:

#### HDLs for analog circuit design\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=26)\]

### Interpreted languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=30)\]

[Interpreted languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) are programming languages in which programs may be executed from source code form, by an interpreter. Theoretically, any language can be compiled or interpreted, so the term interpreted language generally refers to languages that are usually interpreted rather than compiled.

### List-based languages – LISPs\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=37)\]

List-based languages are a type of [data-structured language](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data-structured_language&action=edit&redlink=1) that are based on the [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28abstract_data_type%29) data structure.

### Little languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=38)\]

[Little languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#cite_note-4) serve a specialized problem domain.

### Logic-based languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=39)\]

Main category: [Logic programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Logic_programming_languages)

[Logic-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) languages specify a set of attributes that a solution must-have, rather than a set of steps to obtain a solution.

Notable languages following this [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) include:

### Machine languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=40)\]

[Machine languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) are directly executable by a computer's CPU. They are typically formulated as bit patterns, usually represented in [octal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal) or [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal). Each bit pattern causes the circuits in the CPU to execute one of the fundamental operations of the hardware. The activation of specific electrical inputs \(e.g., CPU package pins for microprocessors\), and logical settings for CPU state values, control the processor's computation. Individual machine languages are specific to a family of processors; machine-language code for one family of processors cannot run directly on processors in another family unless the processors in question have additional hardware to support it \(for example, DEC VAX processors included a PDP-11 compatibility mode\). They are \(essentially\) always defined by the CPU developer, not by 3rd parties. The symbolic version, the processor's [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language), is also defined by the developer, in most cases. Some commonly used machine code [instruction sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set) are:

* [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture)
  * Original 32-bit
  * 16-bit Thumb instructions \(subset or registers used\)

### Macro languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=41)\]

Main category: [Macro programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Macro_programming_languages)

#### Textual substitution macro languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=42)\]

[Macro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_%28computer_science%29) languages transform one source code file into another. A "macro" is essentially a short piece of text that expands into a longer one \(not to be confused with [hygienic macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro)\), possibly with parameter substitution. They are often used to [preprocess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocess) source code. Preprocessors can also supply facilities like [file inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_directive).

Macro languages may be restricted to acting on specially labeled code regions \(pre-fixed with a `#` in the case of the C preprocessor\). Alternatively, they may not, but in this case it is still often undesirable to \(for instance\) expand a macro embedded in a [string literal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_literal), so they still need a rudimentary awareness of syntax. That being the case, they are often still applicable to more than one language. Contrast with source-embeddable languages like [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), which are fully featured.

* [cpp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) \(the C preprocessor\)
* [m4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_%28computer_language%29) \(originally from AT&T, bundled with Unix\)
* [ML/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML/I) \(general purpose macro processor\)

#### Application macro languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=43)\]

[Scripting languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) such as [Tcl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) and [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) \([ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript), [ECMAScript for XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_for_XML), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [JScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript)\) have been embedded into applications. These are sometimes called "macro languages", although in a somewhat different sense to textual-substitution macros like [m4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_%28computer_language%29).

### Metaprogramming languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=44)\]

[Metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) is the writing of programs that write or manipulate other programs, including themselves, as their data or that do part of the work that is otherwise done at [run time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_%28program_lifecycle_phase%29) during [compile time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile_time). In many cases, this allows programmers to get more done in the same amount of time as they would take to write all the code manually.

### Multiparadigm languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=45)\]

Main article: [Comparison of multi-paradigm programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_multi-paradigm_programming_languages)

[Multiparadigm languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-paradigm_programming_language) support more than one [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm). They allow a [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) to use more than one [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) style. The goal is to allow programmers to use the best tool for a job, admitting that no one paradigm solves all problems in the easiest or most efficient way.

### Object-oriented class-based languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=48)\]

Class-based [Object-oriented programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming_language) support objects defined by their class. Class definitions include member data. [Message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) is a key concept \(if not the key concept\) in Object-oriented languages.

Polymorphic functions parameterized by the class of some of their arguments are typically called methods. In languages with [single dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_dispatch), classes typically also include method definitions. In languages with [multiple dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch), methods are defined by [generic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_function). There are exceptions where [single dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_dispatch) methods are [generic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_function) \(e.g. [Bigloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigloo)'s object system\).

### Procedural languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=53)\]

[Procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) languages are based on the concept of the unit and scope \(the data viewing range\) of an executable code statement. A procedural program is composed of one or more units or modules, either user coded or provided in a code library; each module is composed of one or more procedures, also called a function, routine, subroutine, or method, depending on the language. Examples of procedural languages include:

* [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_%28programming_language%29) \(multi-purpose language\)

### Reflective Language\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=55)\]

[Reflective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_science%29) languages let programs examine and possibly modify their high level structure at runtime or compile-time. This is most common in high-level virtual machine programming languages like [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk), and less common in lower-level programming languages like [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29).

### Scripting languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=57)\]

"[Scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language)" has two apparently different, but in fact similar, meanings. In a traditional sense, scripting languages are designed to automate frequently used tasks that usually involve calling or passing commands to external programs. Many complex application programs provide built-in languages that let users automate tasks. Those that are [interpretive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29) are often called scripting languages.

Recently, many applications have built-in traditional scripting languages, such as [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) or [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic), but there are quite a few native scripting languages still in use. Many scripting languages are compiled to bytecode and then this \(usually\) platform-independent bytecode is run through a virtual machine \(compare to [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine)\).

Main category: [Synchronous programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Synchronous_programming_languages)

[Synchronous programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_programming_language) are optimized for programming reactive systems, systems that are often interrupted and must respond quickly. Many such systems are also called [realtime systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing), and are used often in [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system).

### Shading languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=60)\]

See also: [Category:Shading languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Shading_languages)

A [shading language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shading_language) is a graphics programming language adapted to programming shader effects. Such language forms usually consist of special data types, like "color" and "normal". Due to the variety of target markets for 3D computer graphics.

#### Real-time rendering\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=61)\]

They provide both higher hardware abstraction and a more flexible programming model than previous paradigms which hardcoded transformation and shading equations. This gives the programmer greater control over the rendering process and delivers richer content at lower overhead.

### System languages\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_programming_languages_by_type&action=edit&section=64)\]

The **system programming languages** are for low level tasks like memory management or task management. A system programming language usually refers to a programming language used for system programming; such languages are designed for writing system software, which usually requires different development approaches when compared with application software.

System software is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware, and to provide a platform for running application software. System software includes software categories such as operating systems, utility software, device drivers, compilers, and linkers. Examples of system languages include:
