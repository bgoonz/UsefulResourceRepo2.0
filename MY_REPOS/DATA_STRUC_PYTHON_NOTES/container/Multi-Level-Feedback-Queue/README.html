    <p>
      After talking about one of the most popular scheduling algorithms used by
      operating systems to schedule processes, let’s implement it! This will be
      an implementation that simulates an actual multi-level feedback queue
      processing blocking and non-blocking processes with multiple priority
      levels.
    </p>

      Reiterating on How Scheduling Works
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the main jobs of operating system kernels is that they need to be
      able to execute all of the processes running on your computer efficiently
      such that high priority processes are completed as quickly as possible,
      while also ensuring that there is some fairness in how they schedule
      processes; even if a process is a low priority, it eventually needs to
      complete execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to achieve this, a scheduler looks through the queues for the
      highest priority process and then executes it for a time quantum (a slice
      of time), which has been allocated to that queue by the processor. Once
      the time quantum is up, the process has either completed or it hasn’t. If
      it hasn’t, then the process is shunted to the next lower priority queue to
      wait for its turn again. If the process completed during the initial time
      quantum, then it gets discarded and the scheduler moves on to the next
      process in line. Queues are processed in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time quantum is further divided into smaller amounts of time called
      <code>work time</code>. A process is allowed to work for this work time,
      and then the scheduler will begin the loop over. If the process has not
      finished, and has not become a blocking process, then it will be processed
      again for the work time. The same process is repeatedly allowed to work
      until the full quantum time has been reached, or it finishes, at which
      point, if the process has not finished, it will be sent to the next
      lower-priority queue, or if already in the lowest priority queue, sent to
      the back of the line in that queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing to note is that processes in higher priority queues are
      allocated less CPU time than processes in a lower priority queue. The
      logic here is that the scheduler wants to get through as many of the
      short, high priority processes first, then the long, high priority
      processes, followed by the short low priority processes, before finally
      getting around to the long, low priority processes. Oftentimes, these
      long-running low priority processes only get allocated CPU time when your
      computer is idle, because during high usage periods, new processes are
      constantly being added to the highest-priority queue by the scheduler.
    </p>
    <h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
    <p>
      Nothing special here. Just run <code>npm install</code> in the root
      directory, then start working on your implementation, using the provided
      skeleton code and comments for guidance / pointers. Run
      <code>npm test</code> when you want to check your code against the test
      suite, or <code>npm test:watch</code> if you’d like to keep the tests
      running as you work. You can also do
      <code>npm run test &lt;name-of-test-suite&gt;</code> to run one suite out
      of the three.

    <p>
      Our MLFQ implementation will be comprised of two types of queues: blocking
      queues and CPU queues. There will be one blocking queue and three CPU
      queues in our implementation. The blocking queue is where blocking
      processes go; all other processes go into the CPU queues. Each queue will
      have a different priority level, with a different time quantum allocation
      (which designates how much time each process in the associated queue
      receives from the CPU).
    </p>
    <p>
      The blocking queue will have the highest priority (since we want to get
      through blocking processes as soon as possible), followed by the three CPU
      queues. You’ll be implementing three classes, a Process class to represent
      blocking and non-blocking processes, a Queue class to represent the
      different types of queues, and a Scheduler class to represent the
      scheduler itself. Then, inside <code>main.js</code> is where these classes
      will be executed to simulate a scheduler working through processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important aspect that should be touched on is how queues,
      processes, and the scheduler all communicate with each other. For example,
      a process may need to let the scheduler and its parent queue know that the
      process has started a blocking operation, and thus needs to be moved to
      the blocking queue. Or conversely, a blocking process will need to notify
      the scheduler and its queue that it has finished its blocking operation,
      and can thus be moved to a CPU queue. The classes handle this
      communication by emitting interrupts at the appropriate times.
    </p>
    <h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
    <p>The pseudo code for our MLFQ implementation is as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>Loop:
    If a process exists in the blocking queue:
        Work on removing each process in the blocking queue on a First In First Out (FIFO) basis
        Do blocking work for the amount of time specified for the current iteration 
        When a process completes its blocking operation, emit an interrupt to the scheduler
        The scheduler removes the process from the blocking queue and
        adds it to the highest priority level CPU queue

    Beginning with the top priority CPU queue, look through each queue for a process to run; processes should be processed in FIFO order
    If a process is found:
        Do non-blocking work for the amount of time specified for the current iteration
            If the process becomes blocking:
                Emit an interrupt to the scheduler notifying it that the process has become blocking
                The scheduler removes the now-blocking process from the CPU queue
                Places it on the blocking queue
                Restarts the time quantum with the next process in the CPU queue

            If the end of the time quantum has been reached:
                Remove the process that is currently being worked on from the top of the CPU queue
                If the process is not finished:
                    If the process is already in the lowest priority queue:
                        Add it to the back of the same queue
                    Else:
                        Add the process to the back of the next lower priority queue
                Break out of the current iteration and continue looping
            
    If no processes are found in any queues, the scheduler can idle while waiting for new processes
        (in our case, the program will be done)</code></pre>
    <h3 id="stretch-goals">Stretch Goals</h3>
    <p>
      Implement priority boosting within your MLFQ. Priority boosting is the
      idea that there is a global time quantum of, say, 500 ms that elapses.
      Once that global time quantum hits 0, it should reset, and every process
      in any of the available queues should all be moved back up to the
      top-level priority queue. This is one such scheme that is used in order to
      ensure that the bottom-of-the-barrel processes receive some additional
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think about how this feature should be incorporated into your current MLFQ
      implementation. Which component of the MLFQ should be responsible for the
      global time quantum? How should processes be notified that they’re
      recieving a priority boost, and how should that be facillitated?
