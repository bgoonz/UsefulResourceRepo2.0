      The Process of Booting the Computer
    </h1>
    <h2 id="basic-inputoutput-system-bios">Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)</h2>
    <p>
      When your computer first boots, it provides power to various electronics
      components according to the design of the hardware. As each component
      powers up it executes a Power On Self Test (<em>POST</em>). If POST
      succeeds, a very small operating system is activated with low level
      drivers to read and write memory, hard disks, simple display output, and
      potentially network cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BIOS attempts to read the first sector of the boot disc. In the first
      sector is the Boot Loader, which shows the BIOS which hard disk sector to
      execute first in order to activate the real operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Windows, the Boot Loader is called the Master Boot Record. In Linux, it
      is GRUB or LILO. OS Xs Boot Loader is entirely proprietary.
    </p>
    <h2 id="boot-loader">Boot-loader</h2>
    <p>
      The first-stage boot loader is stored in the BIOS and generally reads the
      first sector from the boot disk which contains a small program for
      continuing to load. The small program (usually just a few hundred bytes of
      machine code) loads and executes the second-state boot loader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second-stage, more-complicated boot loader (e.g. GRUB) then does the
      heavy lifting of loading the rest of the OS. Once the kernel is loaded,
      the boot loader transfer control to it to continue the boot process.
    </p>
    <h2 id="kernel-boot-process">Kernel Boot Process</h2>
    <p>
      Once the kernel has been loaded, it sets up the execution environment for
      future processes, initializes hardware drivers, and then switches to
      <em>multiuser</em> mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, it is free to initialize other services that the owner has
      configured, e.g. MongoDB, sshd, etc.
    </p>
    <p>And finally a login prompt is presented.</p>

      Explain the following to someone in class, or in your house, or on the
      phone. If no one is available, any house plant will do.

      (The answers to the below questions aren’t necessarily in the above text.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Why is a first-stage boot loaded necessary? Why not just load the
          entire secondary bootloader from the start?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Why is a boot loader necessary at all? Why not just load the kernel
          directly?
