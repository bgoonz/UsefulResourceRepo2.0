"""

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd,
print out an appropriate message to the user.

Extras:
1.    If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
2.    Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num)
      and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num,
      tell that to the user.
      If not, print a different appropriate message.
