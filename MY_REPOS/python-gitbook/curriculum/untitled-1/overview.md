### Overview <a id="overview"></a>

In this sprint, you will learn about graphs. These data structures are part of the critical computer science fundamentals that interviewers expect you to be comfortable with during the technical interview process.

Additionally, we will teach you about the technical interview process, best practices for interviews, getting unstuck, and overcoming imposter syndrome during an interview. As you complete this sprint and the computer science curriculum, you should feel prepared to tackle the technical interview process successfully.

### Graphs I <a id="graphs-i"></a>

In this module, you will learn about graph properties, graph representations, and how to build Graph and Vertex classes to construct your graphs in Python.

### Graphs II <a id="graphs-ii"></a>

In this module, you will learn about breadth-first search, depth-first search, and implementing both of these techniques in code.
