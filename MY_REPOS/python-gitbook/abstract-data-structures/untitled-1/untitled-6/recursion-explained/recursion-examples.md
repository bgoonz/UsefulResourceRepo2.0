# A recursive function is a function that calls itself. They're an alternative option to iteration, like using a while
# or for loop. Sometimes, they can make code easier to read and write. The examples below are overly simplified and
# have obviously better alternatives.

def multiply_string(s: str, n: int) -> str:
    # There are 3 main parts to a recursive function.
    # 1. A way to go to either the base case (no recursion) or recursive case (function calls itself).
    if n == 0:  # The switch between base and recursive is often an if statement.
        # 2. The base case. This is the case that doesn't require recursion.
        return ''  # Any string times 0 is empty string. That's easy.
    # 3. The recursive case. This same function gets called again, but slightly differently.
    # This needs to eventually get to the base case.
    return s + multiply_string(s, n - 1)  # Add the string to result of multiplying the string times n -1.
    # Eventually, n will be 0 and we'll be at the base case.


# This is also a good order to first write your recursive functions, even if you rewrite in a different order later.
# 1. What input is the base case?
# 2. What calculation needs to be done for the base case (if any)?
# 3. What calculation needs to be done for the recursive case?

# For the base case, there are some common patterns. It's often when an integer input is 0 or 1, the collection is
# totally empty, or you're at the thing you're looking for. A good question is: "What's the easiest possible case?"
# There can also be more than one base case! You've searched everywhere and haven't found the thing could be one
# base case, and you've found the thing could be another.
# For the recursive case, it's often easiest to think of being one step away from a base case. If your base case is
# n=0, think of how to get from n=0 to n=1. This is usually easier than how to get from n=9 to n=10.
