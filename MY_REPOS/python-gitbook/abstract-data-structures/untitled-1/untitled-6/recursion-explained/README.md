# Recursion Explained



### Introduction to recursive functions

A recursive function is a [function](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-functions/) that calls itself until it doesn’t.

The following `fn()` function is a recursive function because it has a call to itself:

```text
def fn():
    # ...
    fn()
    # ...
Code language: Python (python)
```

In the `fn()` function, the `#...` means other code.

Also, a recursive function needs to have a condition to stop calling itself. So you need to add an [if statement](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-if/) like this:

```text
def fn():
    # ...
    if condition:
        # stop calling itself
    else:
        fn()
    # ...
Code language: Python (python)
```

Typically, you use a recursive function to divide a big problem that’s difficult to solve into smaller problems that are easier-to-solve.

In programming, you’ll often find the recursive functions used in data structures and algorithms like trees, graphs, and binary searches.

### Python recursive function examples

Let’s take some examples of using the Python recursive functions.

#### 1\) A simple recursive function example in Python

Suppose you need to develop a countdown function that counts down from a specified number to zero.

For example, if you call the function that counts down from 3, it’ll show the following output:

```text
3
2
1Code language: Python (python)
```

The following defines the `count_down()` function:

```text
def count_down(start):
    """ Count down from a number  """
    print(start)Code language: Python (python)
```

If you call the `count_down()` function now:

```text
count_down(3)Code language: Python (python)
```

…it’ll shows only the number 3.

To show the number 3, 2 and 1, you need to:

* First, call the `count_down(3)` to show the number 3.
* Second, call the `count_down(2)` to show the number 2.
* Finally, call the `count_down(1)` to show the number 1.

In order to do so, inside the `count_down()` function, you’ll need to define a logic to call the function `count_down()` with argument 2, and 1.

To do it, you need to make the `count_down()` function recursive.

The following defines a recursive `count_down()` function and calls it by passing the number 3:

```text
def count_down(start):
    """ Count down from a number  """
    print(start)
    count_down(start-1)


count_down(3)Code language: Python (python)
```

If you execute the program, you’ll see the following error:

```text
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python objectCode language: Python (python)
```

The reason is that the `count_down()` calls itself indefinitely until the system stops it.

Since you need to stop counting down the number reaches zero. To do so, you add a condition like this:

```text
def count_down(start):
    """ Count down from a number  """
    print(start)

    # call the count_down if the next
    # number is greater than 0
    next = start - 1
    if next > 0:
        count_down(next)


count_down(3)Code language: Python (python)
```

Output:

```text
3
2
1Code language: Python (python)
```

In this example, the `count_down()` function only calls itself when the next number is greater than zero. In other words, if the next number is zero, it stops calling itself.

### 2\) Using a recursive function to calculate the sum of a sequence

Suppose that you need to calculate a sum of a sequence e.g., from 1 to 100. A simple way to do this is to use a [for loop with the range\(\) function](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-for-range/):

```text
def sum(n):
    total = 0
    for index in range(n+1):
        total += index

    return total


result = sum(100)
print(result)Code language: Python (python)
```

Output:

```text
5050Code language: Python (python)
```

To apply the recursion technique, you can calculate the sum of the sequence from 1 to n as follows:

* sum\(n\) = n + sum\(n-1\)
* sum\(n-1\) = n-1 + sum\(n-2\)
* …
* sum\(0\) = 0

The `sum()` function keeps calling itself as long as its argument is greater than zero.

The following defines the recursive version of the `sum()` function:

```text
def sum(n):
    if n > 0:
        return n + sum(n-1)
    return 0


result = sum(100)
print(result)Code language: Python (python)
```

As you can see, the recursive function is much shorter and more readable.

If you use the [ternary operator](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-ternary-operator/), the `sum()` will be even more concise:

```text
def sum(n):
    return n + sum(n-1) if n > 0 else 0


result = sum(100)
print(result)
Code language: Python (python)
```

### Summary

* A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it doesn’t.
* And a recursive function always has a condition that stops calling itself.
