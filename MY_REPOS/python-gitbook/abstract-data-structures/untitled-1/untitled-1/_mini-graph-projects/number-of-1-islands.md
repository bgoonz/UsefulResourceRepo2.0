# number of 1 islands

## Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and

## returns the number of 1 islands. An island consists

## of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west.

## For example:

## Unweighted

## Undirected

## Cyclic

## Nodes are numbers, edges are connections between 1s

islands = \[ \[0, 1, 0, 1, 0\], \[1, 1, 0, 1, 1\], \[0, 0, 1, 0, 0\], \[1, 0, 1, 0, 0\], \[1, 1, 0, 0, 0\], \]

## Visit each cell in the 2d array.

## When you come across a 1, traverse it and mark all connected nodes as visited,

## then increment a counter
