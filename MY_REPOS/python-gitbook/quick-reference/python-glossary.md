# Python Glossary



This page is meant to be a quick reference guide to Python. If you see something that needs to be added, please let us know and we will add it to the list.

**“&gt;&gt;&gt;”**

The default Python prompt of the interactive shell. Often seen for [code examples](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/python-code-examples) which can be executed interactively in the interpreter.

**abs**

Return the absolute value of a number.





**argparse**

Argparse is a parser for command-line options, arguments and subcommands.

**assert**

Used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply

**assignment**

Giving a value to a variable.

**block**

Section of code which is grouped together

break Used to exit a for loop or a while loop.

**class**

A template for creating user-defined objects.

**compiler**

Translates a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language.

continue Used to skip the current block, and return to the “for” or “while” statement

**conditional statement**

Statement that contains an “if” or “if/else”.

**debugging**

The process of finding and removing programming errors.

**def**

Defines a function or method

**dictionary**

A mutable associative array \(or dictionary\) of key and value pairs. Can contain mixed types \(keys and values\). Keys must be a hashable type.

**distutils**

Package included in the Python Standard Library for installing, building and distributing Python code.

**docstring**

A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition.

**\_\_future\_\_**

A pseudo-module which programmers can use to enable new language features which are not compatible with the current interpreter.

**easy\_install**

Easy Install is a python module \(easy\_install\) bundled with setuptools that lets you automatically download, build, install, and manage Python packages.

**evaluation order**

[Python evaluates expressions](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/regex/regular-expressions-in-python) from left to right. Notice that while evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated before the left-hand side.

**exceptions**

Means of breaking out of the normal flow of control of a code block in order to handle errors or other exceptional conditions

**expression**

Python code that produces a value.

**filter**

filter\(function, sequence\) returns a sequence consisting of those items from the sequence for which function\(item\) is true

**float**

An immutable floating point number.

**for**

Iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block

**function**

A parameterized sequence of statements.

**function call**

An invocation of the function with arguments.

**garbage collection**

The process of freeing memory when it is not used anymore.

**generators**

A function which returns an iterator.

**high level language**

Designed to be easy for humans to read and write.

**IDLE**

Integrated development environment

**if statement**

Conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif \(a contraction of else-if\).

**immutable**

Cannot be changed after its created.

**import**

Used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program.

**indentation**

Python uses white-space indentation, rather than curly braces or keywords, to delimit blocks.

**int**

An immutable integer of unlimited magnitude.

**interactive mode**

When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode.

**interpret**

Execute a program by translating it one line at a time.

**IPython**

Interactive shell for interactive computing.

**iterable**

An object capable of returning its members one at a time.

**lambda**

They are a shorthand to create anonymous functions.

**list**

Mutable list, can contain mixed types.

**list comprehension**

A compact way to process all or part of the elements in a sequence and return a list with the results.

**literals**

Literals are notations for constant values of some built-in types.

**map**

map\(function, iterable, …\) Apply function to every item of iterable and return a list of the results.

**methods**

A method is like a function, but it runs “on” an object.

**module**

The basic unit of code reusability in Python. A block of code imported by some other code.

**object**

Any data with state \(attributes or value\) and defined behavior \(methods\).

**object-oriented**

allows users to manipulate data structures called objects in order to build and execute programs.

**pass**

Needed to create an empty code block

**PEP 8**

A set of recommendations how to write Python code.

**Python Package Index**

Official repository of third-party software for Python

**Pythonic**

An idea or piece of code which closely follows the most common idioms of the Python language, rather than implementing code using concepts common to other languages.

**reduce**

reduce\(function, sequence\) returns a single value constructed by calling the \(binary\) function on the first two items of the sequence, then on the result and the next item, and so on.

**set**

Unordered set, contains no duplicates

**setuptools**

Collection of enhancements to the Python distutils that allow you to more easily build and distribute Python packages

**slice**

Sub parts of sequences

**str**

A character string: an immutable sequence of Unicode codepoints.

**strings**

Can include numbers, letters, and various symbols and be enclosed by either double or single quotes, although single quotes are more commonly used.

**statement**

A statement is part of a suite \(a “block” of code\).

**try**

Allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses.

**tuple**

Immutable, can contain mixed types.

**variables**

Placeholder for texts and numbers. The equal sign \(=\) is used to assign values to variables.

**while**

Executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.

**with**

Encloses a code block within a context manager.

**yield**

Returns a value from a generator function.

**Zen of Python**

When you type “import this”, Python’s philosophy is printed out.
