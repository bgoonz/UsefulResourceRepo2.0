            content: |-
                **Marketing in the real world** is very different than what we learn
                at school. If you've recently graduated and are making your first
                steps in the business, it's imperative that you know how to use the
                tools and tricks of the trade.


                > **The world of marketing has changed dramatically in the last 10
                years. Those who understand it, will succeed. But those who stay
                behind, will have a lot to catch up on.”**


                In this book I will teach you everything I know about B2B marketing.
                From branding, marketing planning, content creation, SEO and PPC, to
                segmenting your audience and understanding today's metrics and
                analytics methodologies — this guide is the only marketing education
                you'll ever need.
