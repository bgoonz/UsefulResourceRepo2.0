            content: |-
                App Land currently supports English, Spanish, German and French. Other
                languages are on the roadmap and should be rolled out by the end of
                the year.
          - title: Do you support native iPhone apps?

                Absolutely. Both native iOS and Android apps are supported and work
                seamlessly with App Land.
          - title: Will my tasks be marked as done on their platform?
            content: |-
                As soon as you complete a task, App Land updates your task lists on

          - title: What if someone else completes my task?
            content: |-
                Once a task is complete, you will get a notification letting you know

                it!
          - title: Which integrations do you have?
