### Scaler Academy <a id="73bb"></a>

> Scaler is a tech-focused upskilling and reskilling platform for all of us that may have written anywhere between zero to a few million lines of code but want to get better. The brainchild of Abhimanyu Saxena and Anshuman Singh, founders of InterviewBit, one of India’s largest interview preparation platforms for top tech companies, started out with Academy, a course for working professionals with more than 1 year of experience, and has now grown to include Edge which is for college students. Scaler’s courses have industry-relevant curriculums which are vetted by CTOs, regular doubt solving support through Teaching Assistants and 1:1 personal mentorship from people who currently work at some top tech companies and startups. True to our mission, we have already empowered thousands of students, with our alumni working in companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon. But we believe this is only the beginning. Come along, as we build a future together.
