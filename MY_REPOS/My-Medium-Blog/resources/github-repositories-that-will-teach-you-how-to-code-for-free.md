This is a Sinatra app, deployed at [http://docs.railsbridge.org](http://docs.railsbridge.org/). The RailsBridge documentation project is home to a few subprojects, including the RailsBridge installfest instructions, which leads students through the various complicated setup instructions for getting Ruby, Rails, Git, etc. installed on their computer \(whatever combination of computer, OS, and version they happened to bring to the workshop!\), as well as the RailsBridge workshop “Suggestotron” curriculum.

Each subproject \(a “site”\) comprises files stored under the “sites” directory; for instance, the installfest instructions are located at ROOT/sites/en/installfest, while the intro rails curriculum can be found under ROOT/sites/en/intro-to-rails. \(The “en” means “English” — see “Locales” below.\)[railsbridge/docsThis is a Sinatra app, deployed at http://docs.railsbridge.org.

Fluency on the command line is a skill often neglected or considered arcane, but it improves your flexibility and productivity as an engineer in both obvious and subtle ways. This is a selection of notes and tips on using the command-line that we’ve found useful when working on Linux. Some tips are elementary, and some are fairly specific, sophisticated, or obscure. This page is not long, but if you can use and recall all the items here, you know a lot.

This work is the result of [many authors and translators](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/blob/master/AUTHORS.md). Some of this [originally](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-but-useful-Unix-commands) [appeared](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-Swiss-army-knife-one-liners-on-Unix) on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-time-saving-tips-that-every-Linux-user-should-know), but it has since moved to GitHub, where people more talented than the original author have made numerous improvements. [Please submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrzMhx00YiIVAWJg) if you have a question related to the command line.

This repository serves as a directory of some of the best papers the community can find, bringing together documents scattered across the web. You can also visit the [Papers We Love site](http://paperswelove.org/) for more info.

Due to [licenses](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#respect-content-licenses) we cannot always host the papers themselves \(when we do, you will see a 📜 emoji next to its title in the directory README\) but we can provide links to their locations.

If you enjoy the papers, perhaps stop by a local chapter meetup and join in on the vibrant discussions around them. You can also discuss _PWL_ events, the content in this repository, and/or anything related to _PWL_ on our [Slack](https://paperswelove.slack.com/messages/general/), after [signing-up](http://papersweloveslack.herokuapp.com/) to join it, or on our _\#paperswelove_ IRC channel on freenode.[papers-we-love/papers-we-lovePapers We Love \( PWL\) is a community built around reading, discussing and learning more about academic computer science…github.com](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love)

This is a list of [Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) Software [network services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service) and [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) which can be hosted locally.

## free-for.dev <a id="c204"></a>

Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all to make informed decisions.

This is a list of software \(SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.\) and other offerings that have free tiers for developers.

The scope of this particular list is limited to things that infrastructure developers \(System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.\) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It’s a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.

This list is the result of Pull Requests, reviews, ideas and work done by 900+ people. You too can help by sending [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev) to add more services or by remove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.

_NOTE:_ This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer a free tier and not just a free trial. If the free tier is time-bucketed it has to be for at least a year. We also consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine but I will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.[ripienaar/free-for-devDevelopers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to…github.com](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev)

## See how the exact same Medium.com clone \(called [Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io/)\) is built using different [frontends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=frontend) and [backends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=backend). Yes, you can mix and match them, because they all adhere to the same [API spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/master/spec) 😮😎 <a id="576c"></a>

While most “todo” demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework’s capabilities, they typically don’t convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build _real_ applications with it.

RealWorld solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend \(React, Angular 2, & more\) and any backend \(Node, Django, & more\) and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called “[Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io/)”.

_Read the_ [_full blog post announcing RealWorld on Medium._](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5)

## Implementations <a id="6348"></a>

Over 100 implementations have been created using various languages, libraries, and frameworks.

[See the list of implementations on the CodebaseShow website &gt;&gt;&gt;](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld)

## Create a new implementation <a id="c04f"></a>

Or you can [view upcoming implementations \(WIPs\)](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/discussions/categories/wip-implementations).

## How do I get up & running? <a id="a48e"></a>

Follow the instructions in the README of whatever frontend and/or backend repo’s you want to get up and running.

## Can you teach me how to build each stack from scratch? <a id="16da"></a>

Yup! We’ve built step-by-step tutorials for all of our stacks that teach you how to go from `git init` all the way to the production ready application. [Start learning now &gt;&gt;&gt;](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/fullstack)

It is based on Front-End developers’ years of experience, with the additions coming from some other open-source checklists.

## How to use? <a id="266a"></a>

All items in the Front-End Checklist are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential \(in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example\). We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

* means that the item is recommended but can be omitted in some particular situations.
* means that the item is highly recommended and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO.
* means that the item can’t be omitted by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

* 📖: documentation or article
* 🛠: online tool / testing tool
* 📹: media or video content

> _You can contribute to the_ Front-End Checklist App _reading the_ [_CONTRIBUTING.md file_](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) _which explains everything about the project._
