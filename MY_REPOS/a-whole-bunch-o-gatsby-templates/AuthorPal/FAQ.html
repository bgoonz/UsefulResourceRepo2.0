<h3>About</h3>
<p> AuthorPal is an app principally built for Google Chrome that is designed to aid in creating projects like a book outline or blog/etc by using an object-oriented design philosophy. It is a computer-managed system designed to allow you to easily build/plan your creative work and quickly access the information you need.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
  By clicking 'Menu' and then 'create file' you can create a project based on various templates. Files save automatically every time you leave a text element. Currently text can be added using either <a href='#markdown'>Markdown</a> or raw html.

  Note: Color scheme for AuthorPal can be changed by going to Menu: Preferences.

<h3>Saving/Uploading Files</h3>
<p>
  All your work is automatically saved to localStorage every 15 seconds. LocalStorage is sort of like a cookie (but different) and can potentially be deleted when you delete your cache. To save a backup copy go to File (top left) and click Download. This allows you to save a file containing all your work (not just the file you're working on) to either your downloads folder or a folder of your choice if you right-click.
  The data is in json format and can be edited in any text editor/ide capable of working with json. This file can be re-uploaded to Authorpal with File > Upload if you lose your work for some reason (may overwrite data already there if names match).

<h3>Using Markdown</h3>
<p>
  https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/ has a nice explanation of how to use markdown.
  Note: use of headers is not recommended.
</p>
<p><b>Not a fan of markdown?</b> html code for bold/etc also works, or prefix the name of the textblock you're working with with a '*' and it will turn off markdown rendering for that textblock.
