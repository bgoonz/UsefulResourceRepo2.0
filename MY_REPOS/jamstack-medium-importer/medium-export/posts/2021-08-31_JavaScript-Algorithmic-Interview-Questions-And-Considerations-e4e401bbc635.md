### Abstract Data Types

> _In computer science, an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types. An abstract data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This mathematical model contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user. Formally, an ADT may be defined as a “class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations”_

_— — Wikipedia_

\[Linked\] Lists, Stacks, and Queues are examples of ADTs. Other important ADTs that you will encounter are _Sets_, _Multi-Sets_ (aka _Bags_), _Maps_, and _Multi-Maps_. As JavaScript arrays can be used to implement Lists, Stacks and Queues, so JavaScript objects can be used to implement Sets (as keys), Maps (as key/value pairs), and Multi-Sets and Multi-Maps (by mapping keys to a count or an array of values, respectively).

Every higher-level programming language will generally provide some basic implementation of the common ADTs, and will also provide features that you can use to implement your own — though the latter are mostly useful for passing assessments and technical interviews!

### Linked List

A Linked List is a data structure that represents a linear sequence of _vertices_ (_nodes_) that has three properties:

1.  <span id="3c62">`head`: The first node in the list</span>
2.  <span id="4538">`tail`: The last node in the list</span>
3.  <span id="7c5c">`length`: The number of nodes in the list</span>

List nodes have particular properties:

- <span id="6772">`value`: The value associated with this node</span>
- <span id="2faa">`next`: The next node in the list</span>
- <span id="0310">`previous`: in doubly-linked lists, the prior node in the list</span>

Linked lists contain ordered data, like an array. The difference lies in how these two ADTs are implemented; in an array the elements are logically (but not necessarily physically!) _adjacent_; in a linked list they are isolated in distinct nodes that are connected by a chain of _references_.

The homework suggests that linked lists have “no indices, and no random access” — this is not quite the full story, since if you think about it you should see that (a) you certainly could implement indices and random access on a linked list, and that (b) while an array can be indexed in O(1) time, a linked list will have a time complexity of O(n).

Often when you code any of these ADTs you will end up creating two classes that work together; a _Node_ class that represents the vertices of the ADT, and an owner class — generically called a *Container* — that will manage its own collection of zero or more Nodes.

The homework mentions singly and doubly-linked lists, as well as circularly linked lists. “Multiply-Linked” lists are also mentioned but not described; as the geometry of the graph deviates from linearity it is increasingly difficult to describe the corresponding ADT as a “list”.

The homework also mentions typical generic operations that are implemented on linked lists: _Insertion_, _Deletion_, _Search_ \[by value\], _Read_/_Write Access_ to a selected node, and _Size_ (or length) on the container itself.

As mentioned in the homework, the time complexity of insertion and deletion operations on a linked list is O(1), while the search and access operations are O(n). (why?) The space complexity for linked lists is O(n) in general.

### Stacks and Queues

Stacks and Queues are both linear collections of Nodes or Values. They can be implemented as Linked Lists or Arrays. Stacks are _Last In First Out_ (LIFO) data structures; Queues are _First In First Out_ (FIFO).

Stacks are said to have a ‘top’; Nodes or Values (depending on implementation) are pushed onto the top, and popped off to remove them. (The JS Array\#push and Array\#pop methods can be used to implement a stack). While there is a ‘bottom’ to the stack, the bottom node isn’t regarded as anything special besides the last item that can be popped. So a Stack classically has only one active end.

In contrast, a Queue is a data structure with a front and a back, like a line that you might find yourself standing in. And as with a line you might stand in, generally one end is where new Nodes or Values are added (the back) and the other is where the oldest Nodes or Values are removed (the front). (Also as in real life, there are reasons why values are pulled from the back — “can’t wait this long — I’m giving up!” or added to the front — “this is an EMERGENCY — do it FIRST!” — but these are not the typical use-cases)

As mentioned in the homework, you can use Array\#push and Array\#shift in JavaScript to implement a simple Queue data structure. (Can you think of another pair of Array methods you could use?)

Both Stacks and Queues have a length, and in the projects you will maintain these values. The pure ADTs are length-agnostic; the whole point of these ADTs is that they support insertions and deletions at the expected places in O(1) time. (Whereas counting the number of items in the list requires…?) Note also that keeping track of the length of an ADT container by updating an attribute allows us to report the length in O(1) time.

If a Stack or Queue is implemented via a Node type (as you will do in today’s projects) the Node will require both a _value_ and a _next_ property.

For consideration — (a) if there is a _next_ property but not a _previous_ property, what sort of list is being used to implement a Stack or Queue? and (b) which direction should _next_ point to, in order to minimize the programmatic (and time) complexity of maintaining the underlying list?

Canonical operations on a Stack are typically `push`, `pop`, and `size`. For a Queue, the corresponding operations are `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and (yes, you guessed it!) `size`. (In his lecture, Curtis also mentions a `peek` method for Stacks and Queues, to peek at the Node or Value that is on top of a Stack or the head of a Queue)

If Stacks and Queues are implemented on top of a Linked List, then it should not be surprising that their time complexity behaviors are the same as those of linked lists; O(1) for insertion and deletion, O(n) for access and searches. As with the underlying list ADT, the space complexity for both Stacks and Queues is proportional to the number of nodes, so O(n).

Both Stacks and Queues are ubiquitous ADTs; the call stack in a running program is an example of a Stack, as is the command history in the shell (or Node), and Browser History functionality. Queues are often used when tasks or jobs are scheduled; the text mentions print queues, as well as the lobbies of MPGs. At the heart of every OS is a job scheduler, and both the Node and Browser JS environment use a task queue to schedule asynchronous execution.

### Lecture

The topics for today are formal concepts from Computer Science — these relate to:

- <span id="bd48">Data Structures</span>
- <span id="d50e">Algorithms</span>

Data Structures are _the structure of data_. We know the concrete data structures _Array_, _Object_, and _String_ and _classes_ in JS. But the idea of an _Abstract Data Type_ (ADT) is about how we can talk about data organization in isolation from the way any particular language implements them.

Sets — for instance — are unordered collections of unique values. A set has methods to _add_, _remove_, and _query_ elements.

Curtis provides an example of implementing a _Set_ on top of an _Array_, but he also mentions that JS has added a _Set_ class as of 2016.

Similarly, a _Map_ is an ADT that maps a unique collection of keys to a collection of (not necessicarily unique) values. Maps typically implement _get_, _set_ and _delete_ methods.

(If you think about it, you can probably see that each namespace in JS is actually a Map, mapping the name of each defined variable onto the value that it represents)

### Why Do These Matter?

Different schemes for storing data have different time and space complexity behavior. Developers chose an ADT that is optimized for the problem to be solved, and then worry about which implementation to use (or develop) once the ADT has been identified. All of this matters more for larger data sets (and less for smaller ones).

Curtis mentions that typically a Stack or Queue will `throw` an `Error` if an attempt is made to `pop` from an empty Stack or `dequeue` from an empty Queue. (In today's project work this is generally _not_ the expected behavior - look at the `spec` tests to determine what behavior is expected from your classes in these cases)

Curtis also discusses the List type, which allows much more flexible access than either Stacks or Queues. He mentions that the JS Array type is a convenient structure to use to implement a List. He also points out that the JS Array type can be resized as needed without effort by the programmer, in contrast to array types in many other programming languages. (Python Lists are analogous to JavaScript Arrays, and do not require any explicit management — but like JS Arrays, this also means that the programmer is at a remove from the very real underlying complexity that still exists when an array has to be reallocated)

### ADTs in Review

- <span id="f03b">You should know in general what a List, Linked-List, Stack, Queue, Set, and Map are.</span>
- <span id="590e">For the Linked-List, Stack and Queue ADTs, you should be familiar with their typical operations, and know what their typical time and space complexities are.</span>

> The space complexity represents the memory consumption of a data structure. As for most of the things in life, you can’t have it all, so it is with the data structures. You will generally need to trade some time for space or the other way around.

> The time complexity for a data structure is in general more diverse than its space complexity.

> In contrary to algorithms, when you look at the time complexity for data structures you need to express it for several operations that you can do with data structures. It can be adding elements, deleting elements, accessing an element or even searching for an element.

> Something that data structure and algorithms have in common when talking about time complexity is that they are both dealing with data. When you deal with data you become dependent on them and as a result the time complexity is also dependent of the data that you received. To solve this problem we talk about 3 different time complexity.

- <span id="3975">**The best-case complexity: when the data looks the best**</span>
- <span id="5e45">**The worst-case complexity: when the data looks the worst**</span>
- <span id="f7de">**The average-case complexity: when the data looks average**</span>

The complexity is usually expressed with the Big O notation. The Wikipedia page about this subject is pretty complex but you can find here a good summary of the different complexity for the most famous data structures and sorting algorithms.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Qnq1kW7AlvMKFeLp.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>An Array data structure, or simply an Array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called an one-dimensional array. From Wikipedia

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures and are used by every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures.

> Let’s think about how we would implement an array… (a native data structure that will form the basis for most of our abstract data structures)

### Identify the complexity classes of common sort methods

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1FjRLFXIIS9yS-yGb3oWRw.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>\*merge sort can be O(n) space complexity

- <span id="fc01">if we are not creating a new array every time we call merge sort on the left and right side. We can make it O(n) if we keep track of the start and end index of the left/right sides in the original array and pass that into the merge sort calls to the left and right side. In the way we implement, merge sort’s space complexity is O(n log n) because we create a new array to pass into each call of merge sort to the left and right sides.</span>

**_\*\*quick sort’s complexities are a little more complicated_**

- <span id="e4be">We are generally only concerned with the worst scenario when we talk Big-O.</span>
- <span id="19c0">With quicksort, the worst case is exceedingly rare (only occurs when our pivot for each round happens to be the next element, resulting in us having to choose n pivot points)</span>
- <span id="0682">Because it is so rare that this occurs, most people will use consider quick sort to be closer to O(n log n) time complexity.</span>
- <span id="f0ac">We also have two space complexities listed. The version that we used in class creates a new array for every call to quicksort, resulting in O(n log n) space. With some tweaking, we can sort in place, modifying the original array and cutting our space complexity to O(log n), which is just a result of the stack frames that we have to create. It’s good to know this method exists, but you will not need to create or identify this version.</span>

### Memoization and Tabulation

#### Apply memoization to recursive problems to make them less than polynomial time.

> Main steps for memoizing a problem:

1.) Write out the brute force recursion

2.) Add the memo object as an additional argument

> Keys on this object represent input, values are the corresponding output

3.) Add a base condition that returns the stored value if the argument is already in the memo

4.) Before returning a calculation, store the result in the memo for future use

> Example of a standard and memoized Fibonacci:

### Apply tabulation to iterative problems to make them less than polynomial time.

#### Main considerations for using tabulation:

- <span id="7e53">Figure out how big is your table</span>
- <span id="070d">Typically going to be base on input size (number in Fibonacci, length of string in wordbreak)</span>
- <span id="d0e2">What does my table represent?</span>
- <span id="cab7">You are generally building up your answer.</span>
- <span id="4ae3">In Fibonacci, we used the table to store the fib number at the corresponding index.</span>
- <span id="5e26">In stepper, we stored the Boolean of whether it was possible to get to that location.</span>
- <span id="f38e">What initial values do I need to seed?</span>
- <span id="b8eb">Consider what your end result should be (Boolean, number, etc.).</span>
- <span id="8df0">Your seed data is generally going to be the immediate answer that we know from our base condition.</span>
- <span id="b5a2">In Fibonacci, we knew the first two numbers of the series.</span>
- <span id="7d24">In stepper, we knew that it was possible to get to our starting location, so we seeded it as true, defaulting the rest to false so that we could later change its value if we could make that step.</span>
- <span id="331a">How do I iterate and fill out my table?</span>
- <span id="4c27">We typically need to iterate over or up to our input in some way in order to update and build up our table until we get our final result.</span>
- <span id="6db7">In Fibonacci, we iterated up to our input number in order to calculate the fib number at each step.</span>
- <span id="feee">In stepper, we iterated over each possible stepping location. If we could have made it to that point from our previous steps (ie that index was true in our table), we continued updating our table by marking the possible landing spots as true.</span>

- <span id="57c1">Our mergeSort function divides our input in half at each step, recursively calling itself with smaller and smaller input. This results in log n stack frames.</span>
- <span id="ccc7">On each stack frame, our worst case scenario is having to make n comparisons in our merge function in order to determine which element should come next in our sorted array.</span>
- <span id="024a">Since we have log n stack frames and n operations on each frame, we end up with an O(n log n) time complexity</span>

#### Space Complexity: O(n log n)

- <span id="bcbb">We are ultimately creating n subarrays for every log n stack frames, making our space complexity quasilinear to our input size.</span>
- <span id="a561">IDEALLY merge sort space complexity is O(n) see <a href="https://github.com/bgoonz/Data-Structures-Notes/blob/master/resources/General/W7D4/W7_filled_in_LOs.md#####*merge-sort-can-be-O%28n%29-space-complexity" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">merge sort space complexity explanation</a></span>

### Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs quick sort on an array of numbers.

#### Time Complexity: Average O(n log n), Worst O(n²)

- <span id="54db">In our worst case, the pivot that we select results in every element going into either the left or right array. If this happens we end up making n recursive calls to quickSort, with n comparisons at each call.</span>
- <span id="2f49">In our average case, we pick something that more evenly splits the arrays, resulting in approximately log n recursive calls and an overall complexity of O(n log n).</span>
- <span id="5101">Quick sort is unique in that the worst case is so exceedingly rare that it is often considered an O(n log n) complexity, even though this is not technically accurate.</span>

#### Space Complexity: Our implementation O(n), Possible implementation O(log n)

- <span id="7be0">The partition arrays that we create are directly proportional to the size of the input, resulting in O(n) space complexity.</span>
- <span id="c741">With some tweaking, we could implement an in-place quick sort, which would eliminate the creation of new arrays. In this case, the log n stack frames from the recursion are the only proportional amount of space that is used, resulting in O(log n) space complexity.</span>

> Code example for quickSort:

### Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs a binary search on a sorted array of numbers.

#### Time Complexity: O(log n)

- <span id="4547">With each recursive call, we split our input in half. This means we have to make at most log n checks to know if the element is in our array.</span>

#### Space Complexity: Our implementation O(n), Possible implementation O(1)

- <span id="52ef">We have to make a subarray for each recursive call. In the worst case (we don’t find the element), the total length of these arrays is approximately equal to the length of the original (n).</span>
- <span id="5d90">If we kept references to the beginning and end index of the portion of the array that we are searching, we could eliminate the need for creating new subarrays. We could also use a while loop to perform this functionality until we either found our target or our beginning and end indices crossed. This would eliminate the space required for recursive calls (adding stack frames). Ultimately we would be using the same number of variables independent of input size, resulting in O(1).</span>

#### Code example for binarySearch and binarySearchIndex:

### Lists, Stacks, and Queues

- <span id="ec6d">Do the projects over and see make sure to know the following</span>

### Explain and implement a Linked List.

- <span id="9f22">A linked list are a collection of ordered data that track three main components:</span>
- <span id="2e24">head: beginning of the list</span>
- <span id="8b97">tail: end of the list</span>
- <span id="750d">length: count of the number of elements in the list</span>
- <span id="b8d7">The main differences between lists and arrays are that a list does not have random access or indices to signify where in the list an element is.</span>
- <span id="0696">The only references to elements that we have in a list are the head and the tail.</span>
- <span id="cae5">If we want an element in the middle of the list, we would have to traverse the list until we encountered it.</span>
- <span id="4668">The two main types of linked lists that we talked about are Singly Linked Lists and Doubly Linked Lists.</span>
- <span id="9d88">Singly Linked Lists are composed of nodes that only have a reference to the next node in the list. We can only traverse the list in one direction.</span>
- <span id="6c92">Doubly Linked Lists are composed of nodes that have a reference to both the next node and the previous node in the list. This allows us to traverse both forwards and backwards.</span>

### Methods of a linked list that we should know are:

- <span id="333c">addToTail: Adds a new node to the end of the list.</span>
- <span id="a488">addToHead: Adds a new node to the front of the list.</span>
- <span id="3b08">insertAt: Adds a new node at the specified position (we need to traverse to that point, then update pointers)</span>
- <span id="2342">removeTail: Removes the last node of the list.</span>
- <span id="4909">removeHead: Removes the first node of the list.</span>
- <span id="2198">removeFrom: Removes the node at the specified position.</span>
- <span id="3853">contains: Traverses the list and returns a Boolean to indicate if the value was found at any node.</span>
- <span id="9720">get: Returns a reference to the node at the specified position.</span>
- <span id="2b6e">set: Updates the value of the node at the specified position.</span>
- <span id="a42b">size: Returns the current length of the list.</span>

#### Time complexities for these methods:

- <span id="8050">Accessing a node: O(n), because we may have to traverse the entire list.</span>
- <span id="26a2">Searching a list: O(n), because we may have to traverse the entire list.</span>
- <span id="9582">Inserting a value: O(1), under the assumption that we have a reference to the node that we want to insert it after/before. If we don’t have this reference we would first have to access it (O(n) from above), but the actual creation is O(1)</span>
- <span id="10c9">Deleting a node: O(1), for the same reasons as insertion. If we first need to find the previous and next nodes, we would need to access them (O(n) from above), but the actual deletion is O(1)</span>
- <span id="63b3">Be able to implement a Singly Linked List and a Doubly Linked List. This would require you to use a Node class with a value instance variable and an instance variable that points to the next (and possibly previous) Node instance(s). You should then be able to interact with these Nodes to perform all of the actions of a Linked List, as we defined above.</span>

### Explain and implement a Stack.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*8B7lZQ1FEPyAqPfX.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="3bdc">A Last In First Out (LIFO) Abstract Data Type (ADT).</span>
-   <span id="8bcf">LIFO: The last element put into the stack is the first thing removed from it. Think of it as a can of Pringles or a pile of dishes.</span>
-   <span id="cddd">ADT: The actual implementation of the stack can vary as long as the main principles and methods associated with them are abided by. We could use Nodes like we did with Linked Lists, we could use an Array as an underlying instance variable as long as the methods we implement only interact with it in the way a stack should be interacted with, etc.</span>

### Methods of a Stack we should know are:

- <span id="ae28">push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.</span>
- <span id="3e15">pop: Removes an element from the top of the stack.</span>
- <span id="54cd">peek: Returns the value of the top element of the stack.</span>
- <span id="cc83">size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.</span>

### Time Complexities:

- <span id="b73a">Adding an element: O(1), since we are always adding it to the top and the addition doesn’t affect any other elements.</span>
- <span id="3303">Removing an element: O(1), we’re always taking the top element of the stack.</span>
- <span id="75ed">Finding or Accessing a particular element: O(n), since we can only interact with our stack by removing elements from the top, we may have to remove every element to find what we’re looking for.</span>

### Explain and implement a Queue.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*enTP9Hz2ptGOTY54.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="3d35">A First In First Out (FIFO OR LILO) Abstract Data Type (ADT).</span>
-   <span id="9d13">FIFO: The first element put into the queue is the first thing removed from it. Think of it as if you are waiting in line at a store, first come, first serve.</span>
-   <span id="32f7">ADT: The actual implementation of the queue can vary as long as the main principles and methods associated with them are abided by. We could use Nodes like we did with Linked Lists, we could use an Array as an underlying instance variable as long as the methods we implement only interact with it in the way a queue should be interacted with, etc.</span>

### Methods of a Queue we should know are:

- <span id="4006">enqueue: Adds an element to the back of the queue.</span>
- <span id="aab0">dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue.</span>
- <span id="187a">peek: Returns the value of the front element of the queue.</span>
- <span id="9890">size: Returns the number of elements in the queue.</span>

#### Time Complexities:

- <span id="31b6">Adding an element: O(1), since we are always adding it to the back. If we are using Nodes instead of a simple array, keeping a reference to the last node allows us to immediately update these pointers without having to do any traversal.</span>
- <span id="991a">Removing an element: O(1), we’re always taking the front element of the queue.</span>
- <span id="345b">Finding or Accessing a particular element: O(n), since we can only interact with our queue by removing elements from the front, we may have to remove every element to find what we’re looking for.</span>
