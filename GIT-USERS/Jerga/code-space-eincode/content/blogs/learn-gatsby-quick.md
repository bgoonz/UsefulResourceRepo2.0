## **Introduction to Next JS**

In May 2013, when developers at Facebook came up with React, it was with the very aim of clinically seizing this new tomorrow. As a component-based library, React was profound. Not only did it accord web developers an unprecedented degree of convenience to build the UI, but it also facilitated a level of efficiency that was hitherto unheard of.

However, when this component-based development sentiment was at its absolute peak, along came Next JS in the year 2016\. With Next JS at disposal, developers no longer had to limit themselves to building components. Now, they could build entire pages. It presented itself as a complete solution to the developers and provided business owners, marketers, and entrepreneurs with a bevy of enterprising advantages.

## **A Deep Dive**

In essence, Next.JS is a framework based on JavaScript, utilized for building superfast static websites and React web applications. Via its Automatic Static Optimisation feature, developers get the liberty of building an application inclusive of both server-rendered and statically generated pages.

As a platform, the most redeeming factor about Next.JS lays in fact, that it was successful in bringing together the following three functionalities:

- A rich user experience that was substantially faster and more user-friendly than what was ever made possible by other platforms in the past.
- An unparalleled degree of performance.
- The scope of rapid feature development.

Courtesy of these appealing features, everyone ranging from up and coming startups to established organizations such as Netflix and Uber switched operations to this framework.

Consequently, Next JS is now identified as among the fastest-growing React frameworks in the world. And has become the foremost tool of choice while working with any static site out there.
