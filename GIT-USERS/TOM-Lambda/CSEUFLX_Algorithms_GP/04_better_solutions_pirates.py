field where it's rumored a lot of gold can be found. You even have a map that
shows where all of the biggest hauls are located!
Unfortunately, the sun is going down, so you don't have a ton of time to 
search. You decide to take one quick pass through the field. You choose 
only to move one of three ways:
-diagonally northeast
-diagonally southeast
-straight east
If you start at the northwest corner of the field, how should you move to 
maximize the gold you collect?
Can you write a function that finds the best path through a square  
field of any size?
Ex. 
                N
Input =    [[2, 4, 1],
        W   [0, 3, 2],    E
            [1, 2, 6] 
            ]
                S
Output = '27.098 can be acquired by moving
['se', 'se']'
