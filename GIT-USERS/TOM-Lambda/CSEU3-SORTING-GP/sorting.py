"""
- **Insertion Sort** is an _in-place_ algorithm, meaning that it 
  does not require any additional memory to perform the sort operation.

- It works by conceptually dividing the array into _sorted_ and _unsorted_ pieces.

    1. Consider element at index 0 to be our  _sorted_ piece. The rest of the array is our _unsorted_ piece.

    2. Save the 1st element in the _unsorted_ piece in a temp variable.

    3. Shift elements in the _sorted_ piece over to the right until we find where the element 
       from step 2 should go.

    4. Insert the element from step 2 into its correct index within the _sorted_ piece.

    5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all elements have been processed.
