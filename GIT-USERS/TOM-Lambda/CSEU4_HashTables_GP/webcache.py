"""
- Specification Abstract
    - We want a web client that gets whichever URL we specify
    - it caches the results of the web page
    - the first time we visit a URL, it goes out over the internet and gets it
        - subsequent requests for that URL are simply returned from the cache

- what benefit is this?
    - example. proxy server in a big company office whare we have a company firewall that caches data
        - in order to minimize traffic we can make the firewall in to a proxy cache server

- how can we use a hash table to create this?
    - The `URL` is the `key`
    - The web page `data` is the `value`
        - for our purposes the data will be a webpage
