# add-less-import [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/add-less-import.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/add-less-import)

> Add an `@import` statement into a .less file at a specific point. 

This is completely experimental and pretty hacky. I created this as a proof of concept for another project I'm working on, so it's also limited in scope. Currently, this will only add a single less file at a time, and the formatting and parsing logic are fairly rudimentary.

## Install
Install with [npm](npmjs.org):

```bash
npm i add-less-import --save-dev
```

## Usage

Pass a string, the import statement to add, and a keyword in a code comment that indicates where you want the `@import` statement to be added.
Duplicates will only be _uniqued_ when they are in the same "section".

**Example**

Assuming you have a `.less` file and it looks something like this:

```less
// Variables and mixins
@import "variables.less";
@import "mixins.less";

// Components
@import "alerts.less";
```

Here is how you would add import statements:

```js
var addImport = require('add-less-import');
var str = fs.readFileSync('bootstrap.less', 'utf8');

// obviously you would probably want to do this dynamically,
// like with command line arguments. this is just an example
addImport(str, 'components', '@import "nav.less";');
```

The result would be:

```less
// Variables and mixins
@import "variables.less";
@import "mixins.less";

// Components
@import "alerts.less";
@import "nav.less";
```

* `str` {String}:  
* `section` {String}: The code-comment keyword to search for. 
* `statement` {String}: The full import statement. 
* `options` {Object}:  
* `return` {String}
