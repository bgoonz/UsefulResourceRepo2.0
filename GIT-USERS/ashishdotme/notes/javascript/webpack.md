We need bundler because we want to write modular code and split our code in multiple files so that each file has clear task,
We use webpack to bundle all our files into couple of files in end for deployment. Bundling helps in reducing the number of requests
browser has to make to get all the files.

Webpack also allows us to apply a couple of other build steps before it does the bundling.
