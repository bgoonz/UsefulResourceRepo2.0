# Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.

Technology has changed the way we live our lives and also our communication. The bonding is very different than it was before. In my opinion, this is a positive development because of the following reasons.

Firstly, the internet affects our interaction in so many ways. It has made the world small because we can reach anyone easily within a second. For instance, friend who lives in Canada can talk to another in India using social networks. In contrast, when people didn’t have access to Internet, they had to send letters which were very slow and affected the quality of relationship. Therefore, they didn’t really feel connected to someone who is living far away.

Secondly, technology has made lives convenient by letting you search your missing friends or make new friends. As a result, people are spending more time with each other. To illustrate, social applications such as Facebook gives you an opportunity to have video chat with someone new with similar interests like you so no one feels isolated. Alternatively, without technology it’s not very convenient to make new friends.
