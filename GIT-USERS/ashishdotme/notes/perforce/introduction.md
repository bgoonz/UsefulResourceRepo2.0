## Helix Core (P4D)

Helix core is a version control system for large scale development environment.
It manages the central server. The server manages depots, which are shared file repositories.
Depots contain every revision of every versioned file.

## Helix Client (P4V)

Helix client is the desktop client that gives you access to all your files in the Helix Core server.

## Workspace

A workspace defines the path of the depot to files required for your projects. We can have multiple workspaces
in our computer. This workspace “view” selects the files to be copied from the depot to your computer.
