## File Status

1. **Tick Mark**  
   It means the file is checkedout and someone is working on it.

2. **Green dot**  
   It indicates that you have the latest version of the file

3. **Yellow Triangle**  
   It indicates that you don't have the latest version of the file

## Checking Out file

By default files cannot be edited as they are read only. To edit a file, go to pending tab
and create a changelist. Changelist would describe what are we trying to change.
So changelist is basically a container to group all changes together. Now right click on the
file you want to change and add it to the changelist. We will notice that file icon is changed
to red mark. This means that we have checkedout the file and working on it so rest of the users
are also aware of that.

## Submitting changelist

To submit changelist, simply right click on changelist and choose Submit. Now you can make
modification to changelist description and look at changes you will do the server. Finally
you can hit on submit.
