Stateless component in React are components which do not maintain any state.
We can write them in typescript + react in following way.

```javascript
import * as React from "react";
interface WelcomeProps {
  name: string;
}
const Welcome: React.SFC<WelcomeProps> = (props) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name} </h1>;
};
```
