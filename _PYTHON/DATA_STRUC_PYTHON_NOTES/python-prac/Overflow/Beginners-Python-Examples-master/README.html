    <p>
      Basic python CLI programs as examples<br />
      All the examples are useful examples<br />
      These examples are of beginners’ level<br />
      <br />
      Hey guys I wrote these programs when I was just starting up with
      programming, now I realize that many of ’em feel very un-professional and
      useless so I decided to go one by one through all and make ’em more useful
      and professional ! <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: In 2.x versions input isn’t useful , lly , in 3.x versions raw_input
      isn’t useful. Also, xrange() and other methods are discontinued or changed
      in 3.x versions of python. Change the keywords accordingly!
    </p>
    <pre>
<strong>NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS!
Files Outside Particular Folders/Directories have not been checked yet!
Files inside, directories offer much elegant code and explaination
</strong>
