# Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.

# Example

# For s = "abacabad", the output should be
# first_not_repeating_character(s) = 'c'.

# There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.

# For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be
# first_not_repeating_character(s) = '_'.

# There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.

# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

# [input] string s

# A string that contains only lowercase English letters.

# [output] char

# The first non-repeating character in s of '_' if there are no characters that do not repeat.
