    <p>
      Tractability refers to the question as to whether a problem is easily
      solved in practice. Algorithms that find optimal solutions become
      intractable quickly on large datasets. In order to find optimal solutions
      tractably, complicated and unintuitive algorithms have been developed. In
      order to find near-optimal solutions quickly, random or partial algorithms
      have been created.

      Writing a solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem is a feat worthy of
      commendation! However, code that only runs on your own computer is smoke
      and mirrors. Lets make sure that your future employers know about your mix
      of CS and Web technologies by getting your TSP solution deployed and
      interactive!

      Remember how hard we worked on deploying a Github repository to GCP? This
      is the one!!!

    <p>
      You are going to begin integrating all of your skills into a complete
      Computer Scientist Whole. You are going to do this by creating a React
      component, <code>TSPSolverDemo</code>. This component will be insertable
      into any React website with a single JSX element! You can then deploy it
      as a standalone React website, or easily insert it into your personal
      portfolio site as a stand-alone page or an inline demo within some other
      component.

    <p>First, think about what your component should be able to do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heading - Realtime Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)</li>
      <li>
        Text - Describe the Travelling Salesman Problem in your own words. Be
        sure to remind the reader that this is a fundamental problem in the area
        of Computer Science. It is NP-Complete, O(n!), and not tractable.
        Explain anything you think is interesting about the problem and this
        assignment containing it.
