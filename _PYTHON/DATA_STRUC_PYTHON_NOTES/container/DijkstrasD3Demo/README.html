    <h1 id="dijkstras-algorithm">Dijkstra’s Algorithm</h1>
    <p>
      This is a super-clever algorithm for figuring out the shortest path
      between two points on a graph and can run in O(n log n) time if
      implemented with a priority queue. (O(n^2) otherwise.)
    </p>
    <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine the United States is made up of 12 major cities, and that’s all.
      (We don’t want your brain to explode.) All of these cities are connected
      to some others. They’re all connected either directly (e.g. San Francisco
      is directly connected to Salt Lake City) or indirectly (e.g. San Francisco
      is connected to Salt Lake City, and Salt Lake City is connected to Omaha.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Very importantly, the graph also shows the weights (distances, in the
      simplist case) of the connections between the cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now out of this giant graph of cities, we want to figure out the fastest
      path from New York to L.A. so we can set the new cross-country speed
      record. (The record currently stands at 28 hours, 50 minutes; average
      speed of 98 MPH with 3 fuel stops. Do not attempt.)
    </p>
    <p>We’re going think about this problem in reverse.</p>
    <h3 id="stuff-well-need">Stuff we’ll need:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A graph of cities and their distances to other cities, something like
          this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>  graph = {
      &#39;LA&#39;: {&#39;San Francisco&#39;:600, &#39;Las Vegas&#39;:250},
      &#39;San Francisco&#39;: {&#39;LA&#39;:600, &#39;Seattle&#39;:800},
      // etc.
  }</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A set of cities that aren’t yet visited, and some associated data with
          these unvisited cities. Eventually it will be populated something like
          this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>  Unvisited = {
      &#39;LA&#39;: {
          distance: 0,
          parent: null
      },
      &#39;San Francisco&#39;: {
          distance: 999999,
          parent: null,
      },
      &#39;Las Vegas&#39;: {
          distance: 250,
          parent: &#39;LA&#39;
      },
      // etc.
  };</code></pre>
        <h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><p>We’ll start from our destination: L.A.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Take every city, including the destination, and put them in the set
          <code>Unvisited</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the cities we still have to inspect to see if they’re on the
          shortest path.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For every city in the <code>Unvisited</code> set, add an associated
          distance to our destination (L.A.). Initialize the distance associated
          with the destination to <code>0</code>. (“The destination is zero
          miles from the destination.”) Initialize all the other distances to
          <code>infinity</code> (or some approximation thereof).
        </p>
        <p>
          Also add an associated <code>parent</code> pointer to each city in the
          <code>Unvisited</code> set. Initialize it to <code>null</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="running">Running:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          Look at all cities in the <code>Unvisited</code> set. Find the one
          with the smallest distance. Call this <code>currentCity</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the first pass, the destination will be the smallest with
          <code>0</code>. On the second pass, they will all tie for smallest
          with infinite distance, so just choose any.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re interested in the one with the smallest distance computed so
          far. No point in following paths we know are longer, so we just keep
          following whichever one is currently shortest.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Look at <code>currentCity</code>’s direct neighbors and
          <em>relax</em> any that need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Relaxing is the process of reducing that neighbor’s distance from it’s
          current value (remember they start at <code>infinity</code>) to a
          smaller value <strong>and</strong> setting its parent pointer to the
          city that’s within the closer distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, San Francisco starts at distance
          <code>infinity</code> from L.A., but the graph shows it’s connected to
          L.A. by an edge that’s <code>600</code> miles long. Since
          <code>600</code> is less than <code>infinity</code>, San Francisco’s
          distance is <em>relaxed</em> from <code>infinity</code> to
          <code>600</code>. <strong>Also</strong> San Francisco’s parent pointer
          is set to point to L.A.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Remove <code>currentCity</code> from the <code>Unvisited</code> set.
          We now know its distance from the destination city.
        </p>
        <p>
          We won’t find any shortcuts that bypass it later–we find all shortcuts
          first because we always look at the currest closest city in Step 1.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Repeat back at Step 1 until you’re finished.</p>
        <p>
          You’re finished if (A) <code>currentCity</code> is your
          <em>source</em> city (found the way!), (B) all the cities in
          <code>Unvisited</code> have infinite distance (meaning they’re on an
          island somewhere) or (C) if the <code>Unvisited</code> set is empty,
          meaning you couldn’t find the source at all. Destroyed… by the Empire.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="getting-the-route-from-all-that">
      Getting the route from all that
    </h3>
    <p>
      If your <code>currentCity</code> arrived at your source city,
      congratulations: you’ve found the shortest path!
    </p>
    <p>All you need to do now is:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>Start at the <em>source</em> city.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Print out the name of the city (or whatever you want to do to
          visualize it).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Follow it’s parent pointer to the next city in line.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>Repeat until you reach your <em>destination</em> city.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="variants">Variants</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          You should be able to build the <code>Unvisited</code> set as you go
          instead of adding all cities to it initially. Some of the cities will
          never even be considered.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One of the key speedups in the algorithm is how you go about finding
          the the nearest city. You could use linear search O(n), but you can
          get O(log n) with a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue"
