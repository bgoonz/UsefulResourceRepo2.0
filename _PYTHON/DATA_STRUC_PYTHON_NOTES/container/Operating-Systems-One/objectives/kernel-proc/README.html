    <h1 id="the-kernel">The Kernel</h1>
    <p>
      The Kernel is a compiled program that runs the CPU and every piece of
      fundamental hardware and software in your computer. The Windows and OS X
      kernels are completely secret and proprietary, but the Linux kernel is
      available on github (btw, Linus Torvalds also built Git)!
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">Linux Kernel</a></p>
    <p>
      This enables curious developers to build and install a new kernel to their
      own computer. This is the only opportunity for this outside of private
      employment with Microsoft or Apple.
    </p>
    <h2 id="processes">Processes</h2>
    <p>
      Every operating system provides the fundamental concept of a process.
      Processes are applications that run in user space.
    </p>
    <p>An application might spawn many processes over the course of its run.</p>
    <p>
      Processes in modern operating systems run in their own
      <em>address spaces</em>. That is, each process thinks it has its own copy
      of RAM all to itself. Variables declared in one process are not visible
      from other processes unless both processes explicitly agree to
      communicate. (Contrast to threads, below.)
    </p>
    <h3 id="process-table">Process table</h3>
    <p>
      The operating system allocates a list of processes called the process
      table. The process table is an array data about each process, such as
      where in memory its stack is located, what local data is needed for the
      currently executing stack frame, the ID of the process (<em>pid</em>), and
      much more.
    </p>
    <h3 id="process-lifecycle">Process Lifecycle</h3>
    <p>
      In Unix, a process is created with the <code>fork()</code> system call
      made by the <em>parent process</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A process exits when it’s <code>main()</code> returns, when it calls
      <code>exit()</code>, when it is killed, or when it crashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the process exits normally, it exists in a <em>zombie</em> state
      until the parent calls <code>wait()</code> to get exit status information
      from the child process.
    </p>
    <h2 id="threads">Threads</h2>
    <p>At the OS level, threads are processes that share an address space.</p>
    <p>
      In a typical use case, a single process will spawn a number of threads to
      handle various tasks. Each thread has access to all the global data in the
      process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Synchronizing access to shared data across multiple threads (so they don’t
      step on each others toes) is a tricky problem.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h2>
    <p>
      The kernel is responsible for sharing resources on a system between
      multiple processes. In the early days of large mainframes, operating
      systems did not support multi-tasking. Booting a computer might load the
      basic resources necessary to access registers, memory, and I/O. Once that
      boot process was complete, the system would load a single program which
      would run until completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern operating systems support mult-tasking, which means that the
      operating system runs multiple applications at the same time. Because a
      CPU in general can only perform one activity at a time, the operating
      system loads processes, their stack frames, and their stack resources in a
      round-robin fashion.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If your computer has 4 cores, it can only actually run 4 programs at
        once. You might have hundreds of processes that need to run, though. The
        kernel decides which process gets some run time next. In any given
        second, a large number of processes might be switched into and out of a
        core.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Each time a process is paused, its entire execution state is saved into
      main memory. The next processes stack frame is loaded from main memory,
      and execution is resumed.
    </p>
    <h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that spawns a child process with <code>fork()</code>. Have
      the parent print “I am the parent!”. Have the child print “I am the
      child!”. Then both processes should exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hint: <code>man fork</code> or <code>man 2 fork</code>. Pay attention to
      the return value from <code>fork()</code>. It’s a brain-bender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warning: don’t run <code>fork()</code> in a loop unless you’re careful.
      You can easily spawn so many processes the system is brought to its knees.
      For the above assignment, there’s no need for a loop.
