  Correction: Code snippet from server.xml file should be as follows:<br />
  <br />
  &lt;Context path="jspBook" docBase="/jspBook" debug="0"/><br />
  <br />

  Note: Be sure to run mysqld prior to running the mysql command to
  create&nbsp;<br />
  the tables in your database.<br />
  <br />
  Page 19:<br />
  <br />
  Note: You may wish to use the new Connector-J JDBC driver from
  www.mysql.com.&nbsp;<br />
  Unzip the downloaded file and place the mysql-connector-java-2.0.14-bin.jar
  file&nbsp;<br />
  in your classpath (your server classpath). To obtain a connection use
  the&nbsp;<br />
  following code:<br />
  <br />
  Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();<br />
  <br />

  Page 45:<br />
  <br />
  Note: Some readers have reported trouble running the session example listed
  on&nbsp;<br />
  this page. I suspect that they are trying to run the example starting with a
  page&nbsp;<br />
  other than simpleSessionExample.html (perhaps the simpleSessionExample.jsp
  page).<br />
  <br />
  Chapter 3<br />
  <br />
  Page 49:<br />
  <br />
  Correction: All references to 'simpleBean' should in fact be 'SimpleBean'.
  The&nbsp;<br />
  case was changed early on during development of the book and a few references
  to&nbsp;<br />
  the old name remained after editing. The source code is named
  'simpleBean.java'&nbsp;<br />
  and should be changed to 'SimpleBean.java' (as well as the class name
  itself).&nbsp;<br />
  This will eliminate any further confusion. The same changes can be made to
  the&nbsp;<br />
  'productBean.java' file.<br />
  <br />
  Page 70 (CustomerBean.java):<br />
  <br />
  Note: It would be a good idea to actually clear all of the JavaBean's
  attributes&nbsp;<br />
  prior to loading a new set of data. This could be accomplished by moving
  the&nbsp;<br />
  initialization code out of the constructor and placing it in a separate
  method&nbsp;<br />
  called initFields(). You could then call this method from both the
  constructor&nbsp;<br />
  and the loadCustomer() methods.<br />
  <br />
  Page 79:<br />
  <br />
  Correction: Each of the &lt;option> tags are missing a closing bracket. Each
  tag&nbsp;<br />
  should be something like this (the source code downloaded from the website is
  correct):<br />
  <br />
  &lt;select name="spouse"><br />
  &lt;option value="true" &lt;%= (custBean.getField("spouse",&nbsp;<br />
  FIELD_VALUE).equals("true")) ? "selected" : "" %>>Y&lt;/option><br />
  &lt;option value="false" &lt;%= (custBean.getField("spouse",&nbsp;<br />
  FIELD_VALUE).equals("false")) ? "selected" : "" %>>N&lt;/option><br />
  &lt;/select><br />
  <br />
  Chapter 4<br />
  <br />
  Note: The case of several source files begin with a lowercase letter.
  These&nbsp;<br />
  should each be changed to begin with an uppercase letter. The source file
  names&nbsp;<br />
  as well as the class names themselves need to be modified. For example:<br />
  <br />
  groceryOrder.java --> GroceryOrder.java<br />
  groceryItem.java --> GroceryItem.java<br />
  simpleTag.java --> SimpleTag.java<br />
  <br />
  Page 97:<br />
  <br />
  Note: The example showing how to nest tags does not work with Tomcat 4.x.
  The&nbsp;<br />
  code is written correctly to the JSP specifications and actually worked
  just&nbsp;<br />
  fine with previous versions of Tomcat. With the newer releases of Tomcat,
  the&nbsp;<br />
  nested tag example does not work correctly.<br />

  Note: Remember to start the mysqld program before attempting to work with the
  database.
