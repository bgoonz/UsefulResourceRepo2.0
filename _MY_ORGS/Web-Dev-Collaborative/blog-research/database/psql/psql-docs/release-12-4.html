      Set a secure <code class="varname">search_path</code> in logical replication
      walsenders and apply workers (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>
      A malicious user of either the publisher or subscriber database
      could potentially cause execution of arbitrary SQL code by the role
      running replication, which is often a superuser.  Some of the risks
      here are equivalent to those described in CVE-2018-1058, and are
      mitigated in this patch by ensuring that the replication sender and
      receiver execute with empty <code class="varname">search_path</code> settings.
      (As with CVE-2018-1058, that change might cause problems for
      under-qualified names used in replicated tables' DDL.)  Other risks
      are inherent in replicating objects that belong to untrusted roles;
      the most we can do is document that there is a hazard to consider.

      Make contrib modules' installation scripts more secure (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Attacks similar to those described in CVE-2018-1058 could be carried
      out against an extension installation script, if the attacker can
      create objects in either the extension's target schema or the schema
      of some prerequisite extension.  Since extensions often require
      superuser privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining
      superuser privilege.  To mitigate this risk, be more careful about
      the <code class="varname">search_path</code> used to run an installation
      script; disable <code class="varname">check_function_bodies</code> within the
      script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib
      modules to ensure they are secure.  Also provide documentation to
      help third-party extension authors make their installation scripts
      secure.  This is not a complete solution; extensions that depend on
      other extensions can still be at risk if installed carelessly.

      In logical replication walsender, fix failure to send feedback

     </p><p>
      This is a relatively minor problem when using built-in logical
      replication, because the built-in walreceiver will send a feedback
      reply (which clears the incorrect state) fairly frequently anyway.
      But with some other replication systems, such
      as <span class="application">pglogical</span>, it causes significant

     </p><p>
      The code neglected to account for the possibility of column numbers
      being different between the publisher and subscriber tables, so that
      if those were indeed different, wrong decisions might be made about
      which triggers to fire.

      The phrase-search fix added in our previous set of minor releases

      If some partial aggregation workers found only <code class="literal">NaN</code>s

      Reject time-of-day values greater than 24 hours (Tom Lane)

      The intention of the datetime input code is to

      nonzero fractional-second <em class="replaceable"><code>nnn</code></em>.  In

      replication identity flag (Michael Paquier)

     </p><p>
      The bootstrap catalog data incorrectly marks these two catalog
      columns as always non-null.  There's no easy way to correct that
      mistake in existing installations (though v13 and later will have
      the correct markings).  The main place that depends on that marking
      being correct is JIT-enabled tuple deconstruction, so teach it to
      explicitly ignore the marking for these two columns.  Also adjust
      some C code that accessed <code class="structfield">srsublsn</code> without
      checking to see if it's null; a crash from that is improbable but
      perhaps not impossible.

      This oversight could result in assertion failures or crashes at

      Use the query-specified collation for operators invoked during
      selectivity estimation (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Previously, the collation of the underlying database column was
      used.  But using the query's collation is arguably more correct.
      More importantly, now that we have nondeterministic collations,
      there are cases where an operator will fail outright if given a
      nondeterministic collation.  We don't want planning to fail in cases
      where the query itself would work, so this means that we must use
      the query's collation when invoking operators for estimation
      purposes.

      If <code class="varname">temp_tablespaces</code> is empty or explicitly names

     </p><p>
      If a concurrently-inserted tuple was updated by a different
      concurrent transaction, and neither tuple version was visible to the
      current transaction's snapshot, serialization conflict checking
      could draw the wrong conclusions about whether the tuple was relevant
      to the results of the current transaction.  This could allow a

      Such requests are treated as no-ops if <code class="varname">fsync</code> is

      When working with an on-line source database, concurrent file
      deletions are possible, but <span class="application">pg_rewind</span>
      would get confused if deletion happened between seeing a file's
      directory entry and examining it with <code class="function">stat()</code>.

      Make <span class="application">pg_test_fsync</span> use binary I/O mode on

      Previously it wrote the test file in text mode, which is not an
      accurate reflection of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>'s
      actual usage.

      Fix <code class="filename">contrib/pgcrypto</code>'s misuse

     </p><p>
      The <code class="function">pgp_sym_encrypt</code> functions could produce
      incorrect compressed data due to mishandling
      of <span class="application">zlib</span>'s API requirements.  We have no
      reports of this error manifesting with
      stock <span class="application">zlib</span>, but it can be seen when using
      IBM's <span class="application">zlibNX</span> implementation.

      Fix corner case in decompression logic

     </p><p>
      A compressed stream can validly end with an empty packet, but the
      decompressor failed to handle this and would complain about corrupt
      data.
