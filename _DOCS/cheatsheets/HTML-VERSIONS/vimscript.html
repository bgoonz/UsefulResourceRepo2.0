&quot;  Introduction
&quot; ##############
&quot;
&quot; Vim script (also called VimL) is the subset of Vim&#39;s ex-commands which
&quot; supplies a number of features one one would expect from a scripting language,
&quot; such as values, variables, functions or loops. Always keep in the back of
&quot; your mind that a Vim script file is just a sequence of ex-commands. It is
&quot; very common for a script to mix programming-language features and raw
&quot; ex-commands.
&quot;
&quot; You can run Vim script directly by entering the commands in command-line mode
&quot; (press `:` to enter command-line mode), or you can write them to a file
&quot; (without the leading `:`) and source it in a running Vim instance (`:source
&quot; path/to/file`). Some files are sourced automatically as part of your
&quot; configuration (see |startup|). This guide assumes that you are familiar
&quot; with ex-commands and will only cover the scripting. Help topics to the
&quot; relevant manual sections are included.
&quot;
&quot; See |usr_41.txt| for the official introduction to Vim script. A comment is
&quot; anything following an unmatched `&quot;` until the end of the line, and `|`
&quot; separates instructions (what `;` does in most other languages). References to
&quot; the manual as surrounded with `|`, such as |help.txt|.

&quot; This is a comment

&quot; The vertical line &#39;|&#39; (pipe) separates commands
echo &#39;Hello&#39; | echo &#39;world!&#39;

&quot; Putting a comment after a command usually works
pwd                   &quot; Displays the current working directory

&quot; Except for some commands it does not; use the command delemiter before the
&quot; comment (echo assumes that the quotation mark begins a string)
echo &#39;Hello world!&#39;  | &quot; Displays a message

&quot; Line breaks can be escaped by pacing a backslash as the first non-whitespace
&quot; character on the *following* line. Only works in script files, not on the
&quot; command line
echo &quot; Hello
    \ world &quot;

echo [1, 
    \ 2]

echo {
    \ &#39;a&#39;: 1,
    \ &#39;b&#39;: 2
\}


&quot; #######
&quot;  Types
&quot; #######
&quot;
&quot; For an overview of types see |E712|. For an overview of operators see
&quot; |expression-syntax|

&quot; Numbers (|expr-number|)
&quot; #######

echo  123         | &quot; Decimal
echo  0b1111011   | &quot; Binary
echo  0173        | &quot; Octal
echo  0x7B        | &quot; Hexadecimal
echo  123.0       | &quot; Floating-point
echo  1.23e2      | &quot; Floating-point (scientific notation)

&quot; Note that an *integer* number with a leading `0` is in octal notation. The
&quot; usual arithmetic operations are supported.

echo  1 + 2       | &quot; Addition
echo  1 - 2       | &quot; Subtraction
echo  - 1         | &quot; Negation (unary minus)
echo  + 1         | &quot; Unary plus (does nothing really, but still legal)
echo  1 * 2       | &quot; Multiplication
echo  1 / 2       | &quot; Division
echo  1 % 2       | &quot; Modulo (remainder)

&quot; Booleans (|Boolean|)
&quot; ########
&quot;
&quot; The number 0 is false, every other number is true. Strings are implicitly
&quot; converted to numbers (see below). There are two pre-defined semantic
&quot; constants.

echo  v:true      | &quot; Evaluates to 1 or the string &#39;v:true&#39;
echo  v:false     | &quot; Evaluates to 0 or the string &#39;v:false&#39;

&quot; Boolean values can result from comparison of two objects.

echo  x == y             | &quot; Equality by value
echo  x != y             | &quot; Unequality
echo  x &gt;  y             | &quot; Greater than
echo  x &gt;= y             | &quot; Greater than or equal
echo  x &lt;  y             | &quot; Smaller than
echo  x &lt;= y             | &quot; Smaller than or equal
echo  x is y             | &quot; Instance identity (lists and dictionaries)
echo  x isnot y          | &quot; Instance non-identity (lists and dictionaries)

&quot; Strings are compared based on their alphanumerical ordering
&quot; echo &#39;a&#39; &lt; &#39;b&#39;. Case sensitivity depends on the setting of &#39;ignorecase&#39;
&quot;
&quot; Explicit case-sensitivity is specified by appending &#39;#&#39; (match case) or &#39;?&#39;
&quot; (ignore case) to the operator. Prefer explicity case sensitivity when writing
&quot; portable scripts.

echo  &#39;a&#39; &lt;  &#39;B&#39;         | &quot; True or false depending on &#39;ignorecase&#39;
echo  &#39;a&#39; &lt;? &#39;B&#39;         | &quot; True
echo  &#39;a&#39; &lt;# &#39;B&#39;         | &quot; False

&quot; Regular expression matching
echo  &quot;hi&quot; =~  &quot;hello&quot;    | &quot; Regular expression match, uses &#39;ignorecase&#39;
echo  &quot;hi&quot; =~# &quot;hello&quot;    | &quot; Regular expression match, case sensitive
echo  &quot;hi&quot; =~? &quot;hello&quot;    | &quot; Regular expression match, case insensitive
echo  &quot;hi&quot; !~  &quot;hello&quot;    | &quot; Regular expression unmatch, use &#39;ignorecase&#39;
echo  &quot;hi&quot; !~# &quot;hello&quot;    | &quot; Regular expression unmatch, case sensitive
echo  &quot;hi&quot; !~? &quot;hello&quot;    | &quot; Regular expression unmatch, case insensitive

&quot; Boolean operations are possible.

echo  v:true &amp;&amp; v:false       | &quot; Logical AND
echo  v:true || v:false       | &quot; Logical OR
echo  ! v:true                | &quot; Logical NOT
echo  v:true ? &#39;yes&#39; : &#39;no&#39;   | &quot; Ternary operator


&quot; Strings (|String|)
&quot; #######
&quot;
&quot; An ordered zero-indexed sequence of bytes. The encoding of text into bytes
&quot; depends on the option |&#39;encoding&#39;|.

&quot; Literal constructors
echo  &quot;Hello world\n&quot;   | &quot; The last two characters stand for newline
echo  &#39;Hello world\n&#39;   | &quot; The last two characters are literal
echo  &#39;Let&#39;&#39;s go!&#39;      | &quot; Two single quotes become one quote character

&quot; Single-quote strings take all characters are literal, except two single
&quot; quotes, which are taken to be a single quote in the string itself. See 
&quot; |expr-quote| for all possible escape sequences.

&quot; String concatenation
&quot; The .. operator is preferred, but only supported in since Vim 8.1.1114
echo  &#39;Hello &#39; .  &#39;world&#39;  | &quot; String concatenation
echo  &#39;Hello &#39; .. &#39;world&#39;  | &quot; String concatenation (new variant)

&quot; String indexing
echo  &#39;Hello&#39;[0]           | &quot; First byte
echo  &#39;Hello&#39;[1]           | &quot; Second byte
echo  &#39;Hellö&#39;[4]           | &quot; Returns a byte, not the character &#39;ö&#39;

&quot; Substrings (second index is inclusive)
echo  &#39;Hello&#39;[:]           | &quot; Copy of entire string
echo  &#39;Hello&#39;[1:3]         | &quot; Substring, second to fourth byte
echo  &#39;Hello&#39;[1:-2]        | &quot; Substring until second to last byte
echo  &#39;Hello&#39;[1:]          | &quot; Substring with starting index
echo  &#39;Hello&#39;[:2]          | &quot; Substring with ending index
echo  &#39;Hello&#39;[-2:]         | &quot; Substring relative to end of string

&quot; A negative index is relative to the end of the string. See
&quot; |string-functions| for all string-related functions.

&quot; Lists (|List|)
&quot; #####
&quot;
&quot; An ordered zero-indexed heterogeneous sequence of arbitrary Vim script
&quot; objects.

&quot; Literal constructor
echo  []                   | &quot; Empty list
echo  [1, 2, &#39;Hello&#39;]      | &quot; List with elements
echo  [1, 2, &#39;Hello&#39;, ]    | &quot; Trailing comma permitted
echo  [[1, 2], &#39;Hello&#39;]    | &quot; Lists can be nested arbitrarily

&quot; List concatenation
echo  [1, 2] + [3, 4]      | &quot; Creates a new list

&quot; List indexing, negative is relative to end of list (|list-index|)
echo  [1, 2, 3, 4][2]      | &quot; Third element
echo  [1, 2, 3, 4][-1]     | &quot; Last element

&quot; List slicing (|sublist|)
echo  [1, 2, 3, 4][:]      | &quot; Shallow copy of entire list
echo  [1, 2, 3, 4][:2]     | &quot; Sublist until third item (inclusive)
echo  [1, 2, 3, 4][2:]     | &quot; Sublist from third item (inclusive)
echo  [1, 2, 3, 4][:-2]    | &quot; Sublist until second-to-last item (inclusive)

&quot; All slicing operations create new lists. To modify a list in-place use list
&quot; functions (|list-functions|) or assign directly to an item (see below about
&quot; variables).


&quot; Dictionaries (|Dictionary|)
&quot; ############
&quot;
&quot; An unordered sequence of key-value pairs, keys are always strings (numbers
&quot; are implicitly converted to strings).

&quot; Dictionary literal
echo  {}                       | &quot; Empty dictionary
echo  {&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2}         | &quot; Dictionary literal
echo  {&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2, }       | &quot; Trailing comma permitted
echo  {&#39;x&#39;: {&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2}}  | &quot; Nested dictionary

&quot; Indexing a dictionary
echo  {&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2}[&#39;a&#39;]    | &quot; Literal index
echo  {&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2}.a       | &quot; Syntactic sugar for simple keys

&quot; See |dict-functions| for dictionary manipulation functions.


&quot; Funcref (|Funcref|)
&quot; #######
&quot;
&quot; Reference to a function, uses the function name as a string for construction.
&quot; When stored in a variable the name of the variable has the same restrictions
&quot; as a function name (see below).

echo  function(&#39;type&#39;)                   | &quot; Reference to function type()
&quot; Note that `funcref(&#39;type&#39;)` will throw an error because the argument must be
&quot; a user-defined function; see further below for defining your own functions.
echo  funcref(&#39;type&#39;)                    | &quot; Reference by identity, not name
&quot; A lambda (|lambda|) is an anonymous function; it can only contain one
&quot; expression in its body, which is also its implicit return value.
echo  {x -&gt; x * x}                       | &quot; Anonymous function
echo  function(&#39;substitute&#39;, [&#39;hello&#39;])  | &quot; Partial function


&quot; Regular expression (|regular-expression|)
&quot; ##################
&quot;
&quot; A regular expression pattern is generally a string, but in some cases you can
&quot; also use a regular expression between a pair of delimiters (usually `/`, but
&quot; you can choose anything).

&quot; Substitute &#39;hello&#39; for &#39;Hello&#39;
substitute/hello/Hello/


&quot; ###########################
&quot;  Implicit type conversions
&quot; ###########################
&quot;
&quot; Strings are converted to numbers, and numbers to strings when necessary. A
&quot; number becomes its decimal notation as a string. A string becomes its
&quot; numerical value if it can be parsed to a number, otherwise it becomes zero.

echo  &quot;1&quot; + 1         | &quot; Number
echo  &quot;1&quot; .. 1        | &quot; String
echo  &quot;0xA&quot; + 1       | &quot; Number

&quot; Strings are treated like numbers when used as booleans
echo &quot;true&quot; ? 1 : 0   | &quot; This string is parsed to 0, which is false

&quot; ###########
&quot;  Variables
&quot; ###########
&quot; 
&quot; Variables are bound within a scope; if no scope is provided a default is
&quot; chosen by Vim. Use `:let` and `:const` to bind a value and `:unlet` to unbind
&quot; it.

let b:my_var = 1        | &quot; Local to current buffer
let w:my_var = 1        | &quot; Local to current window
let t:my_var = 1        | &quot; Local to current tab page
let g:my_var = 1        | &quot; Global variable
let l:my_var = 1        | &quot; Local to current function (see functions below)
let s:my_var = 1        | &quot; Local to current script file
let a:my_arg = 1        | &quot; Function argument (see functions below)

&quot; The Vim scope is read-only
echo  v:true            | &quot; Special built-in Vim variables (|v:var|)

&quot; Access special Vim memory like variables
let @a = &#39;Hello&#39;        | &quot; Register
let $PATH=&#39;&#39;            | &quot; Environment variable
let &amp;textwidth = 79     | &quot; Option
let &amp;l:textwidth = 79   | &quot; Local option
let &amp;g:textwidth = 79   | &quot; Global option

&quot; Access scopes as dictionaries (can be modified like all dictionaries)
&quot; See the |dict-functions|, especially |get()|, for access and manipulation
echo  b:                | &quot; All buffer variables
echo  w:                | &quot; All window variables
echo  t:                | &quot; All tab page variables
echo  g:                | &quot; All global variables
echo  l:                | &quot; All local variables
echo  s:                | &quot; All script variables
echo  a:                | &quot; All function arguments
echo  v:                | &quot; All Vim variables

&quot; Constant variables
const x = 10            | &quot; See |:const|, |:lockvar|

&quot; Function reference variables have the same restrictions as function names
let IsString = {x -&gt; type(x) == type(&#39;&#39;)}    | &quot; Global: capital letter
let s:isNumber = {x -&gt; type(x) == type(0)}   | &quot; Local: any name allowed

&quot; When omitted the scope `g:` is implied, except in functions, there `l:` is
&quot; implied.


&quot; Multiple value binding (list unpacking)
&quot; #######################################
&quot;
&quot; Assign values of list to multiple variables (number of items must match)
let [x, y] = [1, 2]

&quot; Assign the remainer to a rest variable (note the semicolon)
let [mother, father; children] = [&#39;Alice&#39;, &#39;Bob&#39;, &#39;Carol&#39;, &#39;Dennis&#39;, &#39;Emily&#39;]


&quot; ##############
&quot;  Flow control
&quot; ##############

&quot; Conditional (|:if|, |:elseif|, |:else|, |:endif|)
&quot; ###########
&quot; 
&quot; Conditions are set between `if` and `endif`. They can be nested.

let condition = v:true

if condition
    echo &#39;First condition&#39;
elseif another_condition
    echo &#39;Second condition&#39;
else
    echo &#39;Fail&#39;
endif

&quot; Loops (|:for|, |:endfor|, |:while|, |:endwhile|, |:break|, |:continue|)
&quot; #####
&quot;
&quot; Two types of loops: `:for` and `:while`. Use `:continue` to skip to the next
&quot; iteration, `:break` to break out of the loop.

&quot; For-loop (|:for|, |:endfor|)
&quot; ========
&quot;
&quot; For-loops iterate over lists and nothing else. If you want to iterate over
&quot; another sequence you need to use a function which will create a list.

&quot; Iterate over a list
for person in [&#39;Alice&#39;, &#39;Bob&#39;, &#39;Carol&#39;, &#39;Dennis&#39;, &#39;Emily&#39;]
    echo &#39;Hello &#39; .. person
endfor

&quot; Iterate over a nested list by unpacking it
for [x, y] in [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]]
    echo &#39;Position: x =&#39;  .. x .. &#39;, y = &#39; .. y
endfor

&quot; Iterate over a range of numbers
for i in range(10, 0, -1)  &quot; Count down from 10
    echo &#39;T minus&#39;  .. i
endfor

&quot; Iterate over the keys of a dictionary
for symbol in keys({&#39;π&#39;: 3.14, &#39;e&#39;: 2.71})
    echo &#39;The constant &#39; .. symbol .. &#39; is a transcendent number&#39;
endfor

&quot; Iterate over the values of a dictionary
for value in values({&#39;π&#39;: 3.14, &#39;e&#39;: 2.71})
    echo &#39;The value &#39; .. value .. &#39; approximates a transcendent number&#39;
endfor

&quot; Iterate over the keys and values of a dictionary
for [symbol, value] in items({&#39;π&#39;: 3.14, &#39;e&#39;: 2.71})
    echo &#39;The number &#39; .. symbol .. &#39; is approximately &#39; .. value
endfor

&quot; While-loops (|:while|, |:endwhile|)

let there_yet = v:true
while !there_yet
    echo &#39;Are we there yet?&#39;
endwhile


&quot; Exception handling (|exception-handling|)
&quot; ##################
&quot;
&quot; Throw new exceptions as strings, catch them by pattern-matching a regular
&quot; expression against the string

&quot; Throw new exception
throw &quot;Wrong arguments&quot;

&quot; Guard against an exception (the second catch matches any exception)
try
    source path/to/file
catch /Cannot open/
    echo &#39;Looks like that file does not exist&#39;
catch /.*/
    echo &#39;Something went wrong, but I do not know what&#39;
finally
    echo &#39;I am done trying&#39;
endtry


&quot; ##########
&quot;  Functions
&quot; ##########

&quot; Defining functions (|:function|, |:endfunction|)
&quot; ##################

&quot; Unscoped function names have to start with a capital letter
function! AddNumbersLoudly(x, y)
    &quot; Use a: scope to access arguments
    echo &#39;Adding&#39;  .. a:x ..  &#39;and&#39;  .. a:y   | &quot; A side effect
    return a:x + a:y                          | &quot; A return value
endfunction

&quot; Scoped function names may start with a lower-case letter
function! s:addNumbersLoudly(x, y)
    echo &#39;Adding&#39;  .. a:x ..  &#39;and&#39;  .. a:y
    return a:x + a:y
endfunction

&quot; Without the exclamation mark it would be an error to re-define a function,
&quot; with the exclamation mark the new definition can replace the old one. Since
&quot; Vim script files can be reloaded several times over the course of a session
&quot; it is best to use the exclamation mark unless you really know what you are
&quot; doing.

&quot; Function definitions can have special qualifiers following the argument list.

&quot; Range functions define two implicit arguments, which will be set to the range
&quot; of the ex-command
function! FirstAndLastLine() range
    echo [a:firstline, a:lastline]
endfunction

&quot; Prints the first and last line that match a pattern (|cmdline-ranges|)
/^#!/,/!#$/call FirstAndLastLine()

&quot; Aborting functions, abort once error occurs (|:func-abort|)
function! SourceMyFile() abort
    source my-file.vim        | &quot; Try sourcing non-existing file
    echo &#39;This will never be printed&#39;
endfunction

&quot; Closures, functions carrying values from outer scope (|:func-closure|)
function! MakeAdder(x)
    function! Adder(n) closure
        return a:n + a:x
    endfunction
    return funcref(&#39;Adder&#39;)
endfunction
let AddFive = MakeAdder(5)
echo AddFive(3)               | &quot; Prints 8

&quot; Dictionary functions, poor man&#39;s OOP methods (|Dictionary-function|)
function! Mylen() dict
    return len(self.data)     | &quot; Implicit variable self
endfunction
let mydict = {&#39;data&#39;: [0, 1, 2, 3], &#39;len&#39;: function(&quot;Mylen&quot;)}
echo mydict.len()

&quot; Alternatively, more concise
let mydict = {&#39;data&#39;: [0, 1, 2, 3]}
function! mydict.len()
    return len(self.data)
endfunction

&quot; Calling functions (|:call|)
&quot; #################

&quot; Call a function for its return value, and possibly for its side effects
let animals = keys({&#39;cow&#39;: &#39;moo&#39;, &#39;dog&#39;: &#39;woof&#39;, &#39;cat&#39;: &#39;meow&#39;})

&quot; Call a function for its side effects only, ignore potential return value
call sign_undefine()

&quot; The call() function calls a function reference and passes parameters as a
&quot; list, and returns the function&#39;s result.
echo  call(function(&#39;get&#39;), [{&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2}, &#39;c&#39;, 3])   | &quot; Prints 3

&quot; Recall that Vim script is embedded within the ex-commands, that is why we
&quot; cannot just call a function directly, we have to use the `:call` ex-command.

&quot; Function namespaces (|write-library-script|, |autoload|)
&quot; ###################

&quot; Must be defined in autoload/foo/bar.vim
&quot; Namspaced function names do not have to start with a capital letter
function! foo#bar#log(value)
    echomsg value
endfunction

call foo#bar#log(&#39;Hello&#39;)


&quot; #############################
&quot;  Frequently used ex-commands
&quot; #############################


&quot; Sourcing runtime files (|&#39;runtimepath&#39;|)
&quot; ######################

&quot; Source first match among runtime paths
runtime plugin/my-plugin.vim


&quot; Defining new ex-commands (|40.2|, |:command|)
&quot; ########################

&quot; First argument here is the name of the command, rest is the command body
command! SwapAdjacentLines normal! ddp

&quot; The exclamation mark works the same as with `:function`. User-defined
&quot; commands must start with a capital letter. The `:command` command can take a
&quot; number of attributes (some of which have their own parameters with `=`), such
&quot; as `-nargs`, all of them start with a dash to set them apart from the command
&quot; name.

command! -nargs=1 Error echoerr &lt;args&gt;


&quot; Defining auto-commands (|40.3|, |autocmd|, |autocommand-events|)
&quot; ######################

&quot; The arguments are &quot;events&quot;, &quot;patterns&quot;, rest is &quot;commands&quot;
autocmd BufWritePost $MYVIMRC source $MYVIMRC

&quot; Events and patterns are separated by commas with no space between. See
&quot; |autocmd-events| for standard events, |User| for custom events. Everything
&quot; else are the ex-commands which will be executed.

&quot; Auto groups
&quot; ===========
&quot;
&quot; When a file is sourced multiple times the auto-commands are defined anew,
&quot; without deleting the old ones, causing auto-commands to pile up over time.
&quot; Use auto-groups and the following ritual to guard against this.

augroup auto-source   | &quot; The name of the group is arbitrary
    autocmd!          | &quot; Deletes all auto-commands in the current group
    autocmd BufWritePost $MYVIMRC source $MYVIMRC
augroup END           | &quot; Switch back to default auto-group

&quot; It is also possible to assign a group directly. This is useful if the
&quot; definition of the group is in one script and the definition of the
&quot; auto-command is in another script.

&quot; In one file
augroup auto-source
    autocmd!
augroup END

&quot; In another file
autocmd auto-source BufWritePost $MYVIMRC source $MYVIMRC

&quot; Executing (run-time macros of sorts)
&quot; ####################################

&quot; Sometimes we need to construct an ex-command where part of the command is not
&quot; known until runtime.

let line = 3                | &quot; Line number determined at runtime
execute line .. &#39;delete&#39;    | &quot; Delete a line

&quot; Executing normal-mode commands
&quot; ##############################
&quot;
&quot; Use `:normal` to play back a sequence of normal mode commands from the
&quot; command-line. Add an exclamation mark to ignore user mappings.

normal! ggddGp             | &quot; Transplant first line to end of buffer

&quot; Window commands can be used with :normal, or with :wincmd if :normal would
&quot; not work
wincmd L                   | &quot; Move current window all the way to the right

&quot; Type tests
&quot; There are unique constants defined for the following types. Older versions
&quot; of Vim lack the type variables, see the reference &quot; documentation for a
&quot; workaround
echo  type(my_var) == v:t_number      | &quot; Number
echo  type(my_var) == v:t_string      | &quot; String

&quot; #####################
&quot;  Tricks of the trade
&quot; #####################

&quot; Source guard
&quot; ############

&quot; Prevent a file from being sourced multiple times; users can set the variable
&quot; in their configuration to prevent the plugin from loading at all.
if exists(&#39;g:loaded_my_plugin&#39;)
    finish
endif
let g:loaded_my_plugin = v:true

&quot; Default values
&quot; ##############

&quot; Get a default value: if the user defines a variable use it, otherwise use a
&quot; hard-coded default. Uses the fact that a scope is also a dictionary.
let s:greeting = get(g:, &#39;my_plugin_greeting&#39;, &#39;Hello&#39;)</code></pre>
  </body>
