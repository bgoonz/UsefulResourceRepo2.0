        Smalltalk is a fully object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective
        programming language with no ‘non-object’ types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Smalltalk was created as the language to underpin the “new world” of
        computing exemplified by “human–computer symbiosis.”
      </li>
      <li>
        It was designed and created in part for educational use, more so for
        constructionist learning, at the Learning Research Group (LRG) of Xerox
        PARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Scott
        Wallace, and others during the 1970s.

    <h3 id="everything-is-an-object">Everything is an object</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, everything. Integers are instances of one of the numeric classes.
      Classes are instances of the class Metaclass and are just as manipulable
      as any other object. All classes are part of a single class tree; no
      disjoint class trees. Stack frames are objects and can be manipulated,
      which is how the debugger works. There are no pointers into memory
      locations that you can dereference and mess with.
    </p>
    <h3 id="functions-are-not-called-messages-are-sent-to-objects">
      Functions are not called; messages are sent to objects
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Work is done by sending messages to objects, which decide how to respond
        to that message and run a method as a result, which eventually returns
        some object to the original message sending code.
      </li>
      <li>
        The system knows the class of the object receiving a message and looks
        up the message in that class’s list of methods. If it is not found, the
        lookup continues in the super class until either it is found or the root
        of the classes is reached and there is still no relevant method.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a suitable method is found the code is run, and the same process
        keeps on going with all the methods sent by that method and so on
        forever.
      </li>
      <li>
        If no suitable method is found an exception is raised, which typically
        results in a user interface notifier to tell the user that the message
        was not understood. It is entirely possible to catch the exception and
        do something to fix the problem, which might range from ‘ignore it’ to
        ‘load some new packages for this class and try again’.
      </li>
      <li>
        A method (more strictly an instance of the class CompiledMethod) is a
        chunk of Smalltalk code that has been compiled into bytecodes. Executing
        methods start at the beginning and return to the sender when a return is
        encountered (we use ^ to signify ‘return the following object’) or the
        end of the code is reached, in which case the current object running the
        code is returned.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="simple-syntax">Simple syntax</h3>
    <p>
      Smalltalk has a simple syntax with very few rules. The most basic
      operation is to send a message to an object <code>anObject aMessage</code>
    </p>
    <p>There are three sorts of messages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        unary - a single symbol that may be several words conjoined in what we
        call camelcase form, with no arguments. For example ‘size’,
        ‘reverseBytes’, ‘convertToLargerFormatPixels’
      </li>
      <li>
        binary - a small set of symbols of the sort often used for arithmetic
        operations in most languages, requiring a single argument. For example
        ‘+’, ‘//’, ‘@’. We do not use traditional arithmetic precedence,
        something to keep an eye on.
      </li>
      <li>
        keyword - the general form where multiple arguments can be passed. As
        with the unary form we use camelcase to join words together but
        arguments are inserted in the midst of the message with colons used to
        separate them lexically. For example ‘setTemperature:’, ‘at:put:’,
        ‘drawFrom:to:lineWidth:fillColor:’
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="an-example">An example</h4>
    <p>
      <code>result := myObject doSomethingWith: thatObject</code> We are sending
      the message ‘doSomethingWith:’ to myObject. This happens to be a message
      that has a single argument but that’s not important yet. ‘myObject’ is a
      ‘MyExampleClass’ instance so the system looks at the list of messages
      understood by MyExampleClass
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>beClever</li>
      <li>doWeirdThing:</li>
      <li>doSomethingWith</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In searching we see what initially looks like a match - but no, it lacks
      the final colon. So we find the super class of MyExampleClass -
      BigExampleClass. Which has a list of known messages of its own
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>beClever</li>
      <li>doSomethingWith:</li>
      <li>buildCastleInAir</li>
      <li>annoyUserByDoing:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We find a proper exact match and start to execute the code:</p>
    <pre class="smalltalk"><code>doSomethingWith: argumentObject
    self size &gt; 4 ifTrue: [^argumentObject sizeRelatingTo: self].</code></pre>
    <p>
      Everything here except the <code>^</code> involves sending more messages.
      Event the <code>ifTrue:</code> that you might think is a language control
      structure is just Smalltalk code.
    </p>
    <p>
      We start by sending <code>size</code> to <code>self</code>.
      <code>self</code> is the object currently running the code - so in this
      case it is the myObject we started with. <code>size</code> is a very
      common message that we might anticipate tells us something about how big
      an object is; you could look it up with the Smalltalk tools very simply.
      The result we get is then sent the message <code>&gt;</code> with the
      plain old integer 4 (which is an object too; no strange primitive types to
      pollute the system here) and nobody should be surprised the
      <code>&gt;</code> is a comparison that answers true or false. That boolean
      (which is actually a Boolean object in Smalltalk) is sent the message
      <code>ifTrue:</code> with the block of code between the <code>[]</code> as
      its argument; obvioulsy a true boolean might be expected to run that block
      of code and a false to ignore it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the block is run then we do some more message sending to the argument
      object and noting the <code>^</code> we return the answer back to our
      starting point and it gets assigned to <code>result</code>. If the block
      is ignored we seem to run out of code and so <code>self</code> is returned
      and assigned to <code>result</code>.
