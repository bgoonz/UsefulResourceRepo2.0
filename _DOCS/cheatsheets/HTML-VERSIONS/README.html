      Whirlwind tours of (several, hopefully many someday) popular and
      ought-to-be-more-popular programming languages, presented as valid,
      commented code and explained as they go.

      … to write more inline code tutorials. Just grab an existing file from
      this repo and copy the formatting (don’t worry, it’s all very simple).
      Make a new file, send a pull request, and if it passes muster I’ll get it
      up pronto. Remember to fill in the “contributors” fields so you get
      credited properly!

    <h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
    <p>
      All contributions are welcome, from the tiniest typo to a brand new
      article. Translations in all languages are welcome (or, for that matter,
      original articles in any language). Send a pull request or open an issue
      any time of day or night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Please prepend the tag <code>[language/lang-code]</code> to your issues
        and pull requests.</strong
      >
      For example, <code>[python/en]</code> for English Python. This will help
      everyone pick out things they care about.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re happy for any contribution in any form, but if you’re making more
      than one major change (i.e. translations for two different languages) it
      would be super cool of you to make a separate pull request for each one so
      that someone can review them more effectively and/or individually.
