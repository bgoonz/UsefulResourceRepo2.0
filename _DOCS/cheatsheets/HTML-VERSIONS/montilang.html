      MontiLang is a Stack-Oriented concatenative imperative programming
      language. Its syntax is roughly based off of forth with similar style for
      doing arithmetic in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation"
        >reverse polish notation.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      A good way to start with MontiLang is to read the documentation and
      examples at <a href="http://montilang.ml">montilang.ml</a>, then download
      MontiLang or build from source code with the instructions provided.

    <pre><code>/# Monti Reference sheet #/
/#
Comments are multiline
Nested comments are not supported 
#/
/# Whitespace is all arbitrary, indentation is optional #/
/# All programming in Monti is done by manipulating the parameter stack 
arithmetic and stack operations in MontiLang are similar to FORTH
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)
#/

/# in Monti, everything is either a string or a number. Operations treat all numbers
similarly to floats, but anything without a remainder is treated as type int #/

/# numbers and strings are added to the stack from left to right #/

/# Arithmetic works by manipulating data on the stack #/

5 3 + PRINT . /# 8 #/

/#  5 and 3 are pushed onto the stack
    &#39;+&#39; replaces top 2 items on stack with sum of top 2 items
    &#39;PRINT&#39; prints out the top item on the stack
    &#39;.&#39; pops the top item from the stack. 
    #/

6 7 * PRINT . /# 42 #/
1360 23 - PRINT . /# 1337 #/
12 12 / PRINT . /# 1 #/
13 2 % PRINT . /# 1 #/

37 NEG PRINT . /# -37 #/
-12 ABS PRINT . /# 12 #/
52 23 MAX PRINT . /# 52 #/
52 23 MIN PRINT . /# 23 #/

/# &#39;PSTACK&#39; command prints the entire stack, &#39;CLEAR&#39; clears the entire stack #/

3 6 8 PSTACK CLEAR /# [3, 6, 8] #/

/# Monti comes with some tools for stack manipulation #/

2 DUP PSTACK CLEAR /# [2, 2] - Duplicate the top item on the stack#/
2 6 SWAP PSTACK CLEAR /# [6, 2] - Swap top 2 items on stack #/
1 2 3 ROT PSTACK CLEAR /# [2, 3, 1] - Rotate top 3 items on stack #/
2 3 NIP PSTACK CLEAR /# [3] - delete second item from the top of the stack #/
4 5 6 TRIM PSTACK CLEAR /# [5, 6] - Deletes first item on stack #/
/# variables are assigned with the syntax &#39;VAR [name]&#39;#/
/# When assigned, the variable will take the value of the top item of the stack #/

6 VAR six . /# assigns var &#39;six&#39; to be equal to 6 #/
3 6 + VAR a . /# assigns var &#39;a&#39; to be equal to 9 #/

/# the length of the stack can be calculated with the statement &#39;STKLEN&#39; #/
1 2 3 4 STKLEN PRINT CLEAR /# 4 #/

/# strings are defined with | | #/

|Hello World!| VAR world . /# sets variable &#39;world&#39; equal to string &#39;Hello world! #/ 

/# variables can be called by typing its name. when called, the value of the variable is pushed
to the top of the stack #/
world PRINT .

/# with the OUT statement, the top item on the stack can be printed without a newline #/

|world!| |Hello, | OUT SWAP PRINT CLEAR

/# Data types can be converted between strings and integers with the commands &#39;TOINT&#39; and &#39;TOSTR&#39;#/
|5| TOINT PSTACK . /# [5] #/
45 TOSTR PSTACK . /# [&#39;45&#39;] #/

/# User input is taken with INPUT and pushed to the stack. If the top item of the stack is a string, 
the string is used as an input prompt #/

|What is your name? | INPUT NIP 
|Hello, | OUT SWAP PRINT CLEAR


/# FOR loops have the syntax &#39;FOR [condition] [commands] ENDFOR&#39; At the moment, [condition] can
only have the value of an integer. Either by using an integer, or a variable call to an integer.
[commands] will be interpereted the amount of time specified in [condition] #/
/# E.G: this prints out 1 to 10 #/

1 VAR a .
FOR 10
    a PRINT 1 + VAR a
ENDFOR

/# the syntax for while loops are similar. A number is evaluated as true if it is larger than
0. a string is true if its length &gt; 0. Infinite loops can be used by using literals.
#/
10 var loop .
WHILE loop
    loop print 
    1 - var loop
ENDWHILE
/#
this loop would count down from 10.

IF statements are pretty much the same, but only are executed once.
#/
IF loop
 loop PRINT .
ENDIF

/# This would only print &#39;loop&#39; if it is larger than 0 #/

/# If you would want to use the top item on the stack as loop parameters, this can be done with the &#39;:&#39; character #/

/# eg, if you wanted to print &#39;hello&#39; 7 times, instead of using #/

FOR 7
    |hello| PRINT .
ENDFOR

/# this could be used #/
7
FOR : 
    |hello| PRINT .
ENDFOR

/# Equality and inequality statements use the top 2 items on the stack as parameters, and replace the top two items with the output #/
/# If it is true, the top 2 items are replaced with &#39;1&#39;. If false, with &#39;0&#39;. #/

7 3 &gt; PRINT . /# 1 #/
2 10 &gt; PRINT . /# 0 #/
5 9 &lt;= PRINT . /# 1 #/
5 5 == PRINT . /# 1 #/
5 7 == PRINT . /# 0 #/
3 8 != PRINT . /# 1 #/

/# User defined commands have the syntax of &#39;DEF [name] [commands] ENDDEF&#39;. #/
/# eg, if you wanted to define a function with the name of &#39;printseven&#39; to print &#39;7&#39; 10 times, this could be used #/

DEF printseven
    FOR 10
       7 PRINT .
    ENDFOR
ENDDEF

/# to run the defined statement, simply type it and it will be run by the interpereter #/

printseven

/# Montilang supports AND, OR and NOT statements #/

1 0 AND PRINT . /# 0 #/
1 1 AND PRINT . /# 1 #/
1 0 OR PRINT . /# 1 #/
0 0 OR PRINT . /# 0 #/
1 NOT PRINT . /# 0 #/
0 NOT PRINT . /# 1 #/

/# Preprocessor statements are made inbetween &#39;&amp;&#39; characters #/
/# currently, preprocessor statements can be used to make c++-style constants #/

&amp;DEFINE LOOPSTR 20&amp;
/# must have &amp; on either side with no spaces, &#39;DEFINE&#39; is case sensative. #/
/# All statements are scanned and replaced before the program is run, regardless of where the statements are placed #/

FOR LOOPSTR 7 PRINT . ENDFOR /# Prints &#39;7&#39; 20 times. At run, &#39;LOOPSTR&#39; in source code is replaced with &#39;20&#39; #/ 

/# Multiple files can be used with the &amp;INCLUDE &lt;filename&gt;&amp; Command that operates similar to c++, where the file specified is tokenized,
   and the &amp;INCLUDE statement is replaced with the file #/
   
/# E.G, you can have a program be run through several files. If you had the file &#39;name.mt&#39; with the following data:

[name.mt]
|Hello, | OUT . name PRINT .

a program that asks for your name and then prints it out can be defined as such: #/

|What is your name? | INPUT VAR name . &amp;INCLUDE name.mt&amp;

/# ARRAYS: #/

/# arrays are defined with the statement &#39;ARR&#39;
When called, everything currently in the stack is put into one
array and all items on the stack are replaced with the new array. #/

2 3 4 ARR PSTACK . /# [[2, 3, 4]] #/

/# the statement &#39;LEN&#39; adds the length of the last item on the stack to the stack.
This can be used on arrays, as well as strings. #/

3 4 5 ARR LEN PRINT . /# 3 #/

/# values can be appended to an array with the statement &#39;APPEND&#39; #/

1 2 3 ARR 5 APPEND . PRINT . /# [1, 2, 3, 5] #/

/# an array at the top of the stack can be wiped with the statement &#39;WIPE&#39; #/
3 4 5 ARR WIPE PRINT . /# [] #/

/# The last item of an array can be removed with the statement &#39;DROP&#39; #/

3 4 5 ARR DROP PRINT . /# [3, 4]
/# arrays, like other datatypes can be stored in variables #/
5 6 7 ARR VAR list .
list PRINT . /# [5, 6, 7] #/

/# Values at specific indexes can be changed with the statement &#39;INSERT &lt;index&gt;&#39; #/
4 5 6 ARR 
97 INSERT 1 . PRINT /# 4, 97, 6 #/

/# Values at specific indexes can be deleted with the statement &#39;DEL &lt;index&gt;&#39; #/
1 2 3 ARR
DEL 1 PRINT . /# [1, 3] #/

/# items at certain indexes of an array can be gotten with the statement &#39;GET &lt;index&gt;&#39; #/

1 2 3 ARR GET 2 PSTACK /# [[1, 2, 3], 3] #/</code></pre>
