document describes details of how to implement Google tag Manager on your site.
Using a Data Layer ------------------ To ensure maximum flexibility,
portability, and ease of implementation, Google Tag Manager functions best when
deployed alongside a data layer. A data layer is an object that contains all of
the information that you want to pass to Google Tag Manager. Information such as
events or variables can be passed to Google Tag Manager via the data layer, and
triggers can be set up in Google Tag Manager based on the values of variables
(e.g., fire a remarketing tag when `purchase_total` > $100) or based on the
specific events. Variable values can also be passed through to other tags (e.g.,
pass `purchase_total` into the value field of a tag). Rather than referencing
variables, transaction information, page categories, and other important signals
scattered throughout your page, Google Tag Manager is designed to easily
reference information that you put in this data layer. However, explicitly
declaring the data layer is optional and if you choose not to implement the data
layer, you can still access values from the page using the
[Variables](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6106899) feature, but
you cannot use events without the data layer. Implementing the data layer with
variables and associated values, as opposed to waiting for those variables to
load throughout the page, ensures that they will be available as soon as you
need them to fire tags. ### Adding Data Layer Variables to a Page To set up your
data layer, add the following snippet of code to the head of your page above
your container snippet:

<script>
  dataLayer \= \[\];
</script>

The above snippet is an empty object that can be populated with information to
pass to Google Tag Manager. For example, we might want to set data layer
variables within the data layer to indicate that the page is a signup page and
that the visitor has been identified as being a high-value customer. To do so,
we'd populate our data layer as follows:

<script>
  dataLayer \= \[{  'pageCategory': 'signup',  'visitorType': 'high-value'  }\];
</script>

For example, Google Tag Manager can be configured to fire tags on all pages
marked as `signup` and/or on which the visitor has been marked as `high-value`.
It's important that this data layer snippet be set above the container snippet
as described in the [Quick Start
Guide](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/tag-manager/quickstart).
If the data layer code is called after the container snippet, any variables
declared within will not be available for Google Tag Manager to selectively fire
tags on page load. Here are some examples: #### Incorrect

<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
...
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->
<script>
  dataLayer \= \[{  'pageCategory': 'signup',  'visitorType': 'high-value'  }\];
</script>

#### Correct

<script>
  dataLayer \= \[{  'pageCategory': 'signup',  'visitorType': 'high-value'  }\];
</script>
<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
...
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->

Each of the variables declared within the data layer object will persist as long
as the visitor remains on the current page. Data layer variables that are
relevant across pages (e.g. `visitorType`) must therefore be declared in the
data layer on each page of your website. While you don't need to put the same
set of variables in the data layer on every page, you should use a consistent
naming convention. In other words, if you set the page category on the signup
page using `pageCategory`, to set a page category on a purchase page, you should
do so using `pageCategory` as well. Explicitly declaring a data layer is
optional. Therefore, if you choose not to implement the data layer code and
populate it with variables, the Google Tag Manager container snippet will
initiate a data layer object for you. ### Using the Data Layer with HTML Event
Handlers Google Tag Manager provides a special data layer variable called an
`event` that is used within JavaScript event listeners to initiate tag firing
when a user interacts with website elements such as a button. For example, you
may want to fire a conversion tracking tag when a user clicks the `Submit`
button on a newsletter signup form. Events may be called based on user
interaction with website elements such as links, buttons, components of a menu
system, or based on other JavaScript (e.g. time delays, etc.). This
functionality is accomplished by calling the `push` API as a method of the data
layer on your page (e.g. attached to the particular elements to be tracked). The
basic syntax for setting an event, then, is as follows: dataLayer.push({'event':
'event\_name'}); where `event_name` is a string indicating what the given event
or element is. As an example, to set an event when a user clicks a button, you
might modify the button's link to call the `push()` API as follows:

<a
  href\="#"
  name\="button1"
  onclick\="dataLayer.push({'event': 'button1-click'});"
  \
  >Button 1</a
>

Sometimes, the data you wish to collect or use to trigger certain tags may not
load until after the user has interacted with the page. Using a combination of
data layer variables and events, you may dynamically push this information to
your data layer as necessary. Data layer variables may be pushed dynamically to
the data layer to capture information such as values entered or selected in a
form, metadata associated with a video that the visitor is playing, the color of
a product (e.g. a car) customized by the visitor, the destination URLs of
clicked links, etc. As with events, this functionality is accomplished by
calling the `push()` API to add or replace data layer variables in the data
layer. The basic syntax for setting dynamic data layer variables, then, is as
follows: dataLayer.push({'variable\_name': 'variable\_value'}); Where
`variable_name` is a string indicating the name of the data layer variable to be
set, and `variable_value` is a string indicating the value of the data layer
variable to be set or replaced. As an example, to set a data layer variable with
a color preference when the visitor engages with a car customization widget, you
might push the following dynamic data layer variable: dataLayer.push({'color':
'red'}); ### One Push, Multiple Variables Instead of using `dataLayer.push()`
for each variable and event, you can push multiple variables and events at once.
Here's an example of how to do this: dataLayer.push({ 'color': 'red',
'conversionValue': 50, 'event': 'customizeCar' }); You can use the same
technique within a link event handler:

<a
  href\="#"
  name\="color"
  onclick\="dataLayer.push({  'color': 'red',  'conversionValue': 50,  'event': 'customizeCar'});"
  \
  >Customize Color</a
>

It's important to note that pushing a variable of the same name as an existing
variable to the data layer will cause the existing value to be overwritten by
the new value. For example, if upon clicking the above link, there were already
a variable named `color` with a value of `blue` declared within the data layer,
that value would be overwritten moving forward with the new value of `red`. ###
How the Asynchronous Syntax Works Google Tag Manager is an asynchronous tag,
meaning that when it executes, it does not block other elements from rendering
on the page. It also causes the other tags that are deployed via Google Tag
Manager to be deployed asynchronously, meaning that a slow loading tag won't
block other tracking tags. The dataLayer object is what makes the asynchronous
syntax possible. It acts as a queue, which is a first-in,first-out data
structure that collects API calls and tags are fired according to those API
calls. To add something to the queue, use the `dataLayer.push` method. The
`dataLayer.push` method can be used to pass in extra metadata to Google Tag
Manager via
[variables](http://support.google.com/tagmanager/bin/answer.py?answer=2644341)
and can be used to specify events. The creation of the dataLayer object can
either be specified before the Google Tag Manager snippet, or it will be created
by Google Tag Manager if the dataLayer object hasn't already been defined. For
more information on the asynchronous syntax, read the [Tracking Reference for
the `dataLayer.push`
method](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/tag-manager/reference#reference).
### Avoiding Common Pitfalls When implementing Google Tag Manager, keep the
following in mind: #### Do not overwrite your dataLayer When you use assignment
to assign values to `dataLayer` e.g. `dataLayer = [{'item': 'value'}]`, it will
overwrite any existing values. It is best to declare your dataLayer as high up
in your source code as possible, _above_ your container snippet or any [Optimize
page hiding
snippet](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/optimize). After
your `dataLayer` has been declared, you can use `dataLayer.push({'item':
'value'})` to add additional values to it later in your scripts. #### The
dataLayer object name is case-sensitive If you try to push a variable or event
without the proper casing, the push will not work. Examples:
datalayer.push({'pageTitle': 'Home'}); // Won't work
dataLayer.push({'pageTitle': 'Home'}); // Better #### Variable names should be
enclosed in quotes While quotes are not strictly required for variable names
that consist of only letters, numbers, and underscores, and which are not
reserved words (e.g. function, export, native, etc.), to avoid issues, it's
recommended that all variable names be enclosed in quotes. Examples:
dataLayer.push({new\-variable: 'value'}); // Won't work
dataLayer.push({'new-variable': 'value'}); // Better #### Variable names should
be kept consistent across pages If you use different variable names for the same
variables on different pages, GTM will be unable to consistently fire tags in
all desired locations. Examples: ##### Won't work // Homepage:
dataLayer.push({'visitorType': 'low-value'});// Checkout Page:
dataLayer.push({'visitor\_type': 'high-value'}); ##### Better // Homepage:
dataLayer.push({'visitorType': 'low-value'});// Checkout Page:
dataLayer.push({'visitorType': 'high-value'}); #### Any information needed to
fire tags on a page load must be declared in the data layer above the container
snippet In order to fire tags on a page load matching some condition (e.g. on
pages marked as having a pageCategory of `sports`), the pageCategory must be
defined in the data layer above the container snippet (e.g. `'pageCategory':
'sports'`). Variables pushed to the data layer (i.e. using `dataLayer.push()`)
after the container snippet will not be able to fire tags on page loads with a
matching condition. #### Tags deployed with Google Tag Manager should not be
left hard-coded or deployed by another tool as well Any tags that are fired from
Google Tag Manager should be _migrated_ to Google Tag Manager, not just
duplicated (for more information about migrating tags, see [Migrating Tags to
Google Tag Manager](#migration)). Deploying tags both with Google Tag Manager
and through other systems or hard-coded on your site may result in inflation of
data (and other data integrity issues) resulting from those tags. For example,
if you migrate your Google Analytics tracking code to fire from Google Tag
Manager, the hard-coded Google Analytics tracking code should be removed from
your site. ### Renaming the Data Layer By default, the data layer initiated and
referenced by Google Tag Manager will be called `dataLayer`. If you'd prefer to
use a different name for your data layer, you may do so by replacing the data
layer parameter value (highlighted below) in your container snippet with the
name of your choice.

<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script>
  (function(w,d,s,l,i){w\[l\]=w\[l\]||\[\];w\[l\].push({'gtm.start':
  new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f\=d.getElementsByTagName(s)\[0\],
  j\=d.createElement(s),dl\=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async\=true;j.src\=
  'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
  })(window,document,'script','myNewName','GTM-XXXX');
</script>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->

Then, all references to your data layer (i.e. when declaring the data layer
above the snippet and when pushing events or dynamic Data Layer Variables to the
data layer with the `push()` API) should also be adjusted to reflect your custom
data layer name:

<script>
  myNewName \= \[{  // ...  }\];  myNewName.push({'variable\_name': 'variable\_value'});
</script>

Migrating Tags to Google Tag Manager ------------------------------------ In
order to gain the most value from Google Tag Manager, we recommend that you
migrate most of your existing tags into Google Tag Manager (tags that are [not
supported](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103576) should not be
migrated). This section describes a best practice migration workflow. The
process has 5 main steps: 1. **Map your site (optional)** To begin your
migration, you'll want to think about which tags you currently have deployed on
your site and what data you're trying to collect. For data collection think
about what actions you want to track (events) and what additional data from the
page you'll want to collect (variables). Create a map of tags, the data you want
those tags to collect, and which events or pages you want to associate with
those tags. 2. **Implement standard Google Tag Manager snippet** Once you've
mapped your site, you'll want to install just the single Google Tag Manager
snippet on your site (empty) and deploy it. See [Quick
Start](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/tag-manager/quickstart)
for more information. 3. **Add Events and Variables** Customize your Google Tag
Manager installation using the methods outlined in the [Add Events and
Variables](#events) section. 4. **Add tags with associated triggers in Google
Tag Manager's management interface** After you've completed setting up the site
with the Google Tag Manager snippet and data collection APIs, you should add
your site
[tags](http://support.google.com/tagmanager/bin/answer.py?answer=2574372) to the
user interface. DO NOT publish at this time. Simply add and configure the tags
from your site in the Google Tag Manager management interface using the
appropriate templates and set up the triggers appropriately (more information
about how to do this in our [Help Center
Triggers](http://support.google.com/tagmanager/bin/answer.py?answer=2644396)
article). 5. **Final migration swap** The last step is where you simultaneously
swap out your old tags and publish your tags in Google Tag Manager. Within a few
minutes of each other, you'll want to: * Remove your site tags in a single code
push * Once you know this push is successful, press the "Publish" button for
your container version. This method might cause a small gap in data, but once
the initial swap occurs, no more data gaps will appear. Alternatively, you could
swap the order here and publish shortly before your site changes go live. This
might cause minor, one-time data duplication instead of a small data gap. After
you've completed the initial migration to Google Tag Manager, any subsequent
tagging needs you have can be handled without site code changes via the Google
Tag Manager interface. Multiple Domains ---------------- While you can use the
same container for multiple websites it's recommended that each separate web
property that you manage be deployed with its own container. This separation
will prevent changes specific to one website from having undesired effects on
other websites using the same container. In some situations, however, when
multiple Top Level Domains or subdomains are considered to be members of the
same website, it may be beneficial to manage their tags through the same Google
Tag Manager container. When choosing to use a single container across multiple
domains, it's important to carefully configure your tags and triggers within
Google Tag Manager. Using the default "All Pages" trigger in Google Tag Manager
(i.e. `$url matches RegEx .*`) will fire tags on all pages of all domains on
which your container snippet is deployed. Since some tags have configurations or
purposes specific to the domain on which they're deployed, you may need to
create custom triggers (or even remove the "All Pages" trigger) to fire tags on
all pages of one or each domain individually. For example, you may choose to
deploy your Google Analytics tracking code through GTM with configurations to
support GA tracking across [multiple domains or
subdomains](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite).
![Image showing multiple
domains](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/tag-manager/img/cross-domain.png)
In such a case, you would add a line of code to your GA tracking code to
manually set the first-party domain on which to set the GA cookies (e.g. on
`www.example-petstore.com` and `dogs.example-petstore.com`, you might set the
cookies to the common domain, `.example-petstore.com`). However, on the
secondary site, `www.my-example-blogsite.com`, you might set the cookies to
`.my-example-blogsite.com`. Therefore, you would want one of two GA tracking
code tags (one set to `.example-petstore.com`, and one set to
`.my-example-blogsite.com`) to fire on each of the two domains. If both domains
were sharing a common GTM container, using the default "All Pages" trigger in
Google Tag Manager, would cause each tag to fire on all pages of both domains.
Multiple Containers on a Page ----------------------------- For the best
performance of a page, keep the number of Google Tag Manager containers on the
page minimal. If you use more than one container on a page, implement the
container snippets with a common data layer object. For example, you may
implement two container snippets as follows: 1. Copy the following JavaScript
and paste it as close to the opening `<head>
  ` tag as possible on the page:

  <!-- Google Tag Manager -->
  <script>
    (function(w,d,s,l,i){w\[l\]=w\[l\]||\[\];w\[l\].push({'gtm.start':
        new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f\=d.getElementsByTagName(s)\[0\],
        j\=d.createElement(s),dl\=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async\=true;j.src\=
        'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
        })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXX');
  </script>
  <script>
    (function(w,d,s,l,i){w\[l\]=w\[l\]||\[\];w\[l\].push({'gtm.start':
        new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f\=d.getElementsByTagName(s)\[0\],
        j\=d.createElement(s),dl\=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async\=true;j.src\=
        'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
        })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-YYYY');
  </script>
  <!-- End Google Tag Manager -->

  2. Copy the following snippet and paste it immediately after the opening `
  <body>
    ` tag on the page:

    <!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
    <noscript
      ><iframe
        src\="//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXX"
        height\="0"
        width\="0"
        style\="display:none;visibility:hidden"
        \
      ></iframe></noscript
    ><noscript
      ><iframe
        src\="//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-YYYY"
        height\="0"
        width\="0"
        style\="display:none;visibility:hidden"
        \
      ></iframe
    ></noscript>
    <!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->

    Note that you can use only a single common data layer for all Google Tag
    Manager containers on a page because using more than one data layer can
    cause some triggers to stop working and could have other implications. So
    don't rename the data layer for a subset of containers on the page. You can,
    if necessary, rename the data layer for all containers on the page. Avoid
    implementing a Google Tag Manager container through a custom HTML tag in
    another Google Tag Manager container because it could add latency in the
    tags from the secondary container and could have other implications. Adding
    Data Layer Variables for Devices without JavaScript Support
    ------------------------------------------------------------------ In order
    to accommodate visitors who have JavaScript disabled or are visiting from
    devices that don't support JavaScript, Google Tag Manager includes a
    `<noscript
      >` snippet to deploy non-JavaScript dependent tags even when the primary
      GTM JavaScript cannot load. It's important to note, however, that the data
      layer (containing the data layer variables declared on page load) and any
      events or dynamic data layer variables pushed to the data layer all rely
      on JavaScript to function. Therefore, if any of the triggers to fire your
      non-JavaScript dependent tags (that you want to fire even when JavaScript
      can't load) depend on data layer variables, you must pass those Data Layer
      Variables to the `<noscript
        >` iframe as query parameters. For example, to fire a tag when the
        `pageCategory` is `sports` and the `visitorType` is `returning`, you
        would modify the container snippet on the given page as follows:

        <!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
        <noscript
          ><iframe
            src\="//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXX&pageCategory=sports&visitorType=returning"
            height\="0"
            width\="0"
            style\="display:none;visibility:hidden"
            \
          ></iframe
        ></noscript>
        <!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->

        Where each data layer variable is appended to the end of the iframe's
        source URL as plain text query parameters separated by ampersands.
        Security -------- Google Tag Manager incorporates a host of features to
        help ensure the security of your websites and apps. In addition to the
        following code-level security features, you may also want to familiarize
        yourself with Tag Manager's [access
        controls](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107011) ,
        [2-step
        verification](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/4525539), and
        [malware
        detection](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6328489).
        Administrators can [restrict tag
        deployment](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/tag-manager/web/restrict)
        for their installations to allow only specific tags to be deployed. You
        can also configure Google Tag Manager to work with a [CSP
        implementation](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/tag-manager/web/csp).
        Using a protocol-relative URL ----------------------------- By default,
        the Google Tag Manager container snippet always uses https to load
        containers (i.e., `https://www.googletagmanager.com`). This helps
        protect your container from malicious parties and snooping, and in many
        cases, also improves performance. If you'd prefer to load your Google
        Tag Manager containers in a protocol-relative manner, you may do so by
        adjusting the source URL protocol (highlighted below) in your container
        snippet to be `//` instead of `https://`.

        <!-- Google Tag Manager -->
        <script>
          (function(w,d,s,l,i){w\[l\]=w\[l\]||\[\];w\[l\].push({'gtm.start':
          new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f\=d.getElementsByTagName(s)\[0\],
          j\=d.createElement(s),dl\=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async\=true;j.src\=
          '//www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
          })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXX');
        </script>
        <!-- End Google Tag Manager -->

        <!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
        <noscript
          ><iframe
            src\="//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXX"
            height\="0"
            width\="0"
            style\="display:none;visibility:hidden"
            \
          ></iframe
        ></noscript>
        <!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->

        When using a protocol-relative URL, the container would be loaded using
        http on pages with an `http://` URL; and, would be loaded using https on
        pages with an `https://` URL. Older versions of the Google Tag Manager
        container snippet always used a protocol-relative URL to load containers
        (i.e., `//www.googletagmanager.com`). These older protocol-relative
        versions of the Google Tag Manager container snippet will continue to
        work without being updated. While most of the tag templates in Google
        Tag Manager are also protocol relative, it's important to make sure
        that, when setting up custom tags to fire on secure pages, those tags
        are also either protocol relative or secure.
