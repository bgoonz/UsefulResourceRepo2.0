This repository contains the code for my portfolio website, www.harrisonjansma.com The original html, css, and php were acquired from a free Colorlib theme found <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/personal/">here</a>. It was a lot of fun tweaking the HTML to make the template my own. I learned a lot about HTML and CSS in the process of making this site.

## Things I learned:

#### 1. Basic HTML and CSS manipulation.

You would be suprised at how often knowing this has come in handy. Web scraping is easier. And my Jupyter write-ups look much more put together. (Who knew you could integrate HTML and CSS into your notebook code to make your write-ups pretty?)

#### 2. Basic backend setup and deployment.

I deployed the website on DigitalOcean through an Apache server. I learned about server management, security, and the HTTP protocol.

#### 3. Importance of aesthetics to presenting your ideas.

Building a platform for displaying my work has made me reflect about my target audience. Going forward, I only aim to produce the highest quality write-ups, that are inherently interesting and useful.
