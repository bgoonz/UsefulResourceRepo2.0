## Intro

Welcome to Ruth's Web Audio Workshop

#### What you'll learn

- How to begin loading, playing and muting sounds
- An understanding of the audio graph and nodes


#### What you'll need

- You need to know HTML, CSS & JavaScript to do these workshops.
- You will need access to github and know basic git commands or how to use the github desktop client.
- Please have the latest version of Chrome or Firefox installed.
- We'll be writing code! Whatever your choice of code editor or IDE is fine, but please make sure you have one :)
- We'll run the workshop files via a simple python server as this works across all systems: The files need to be served, if you prefer a different method that is all well and good.
