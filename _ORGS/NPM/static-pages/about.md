# About npm

npm is lots of things.

* npm is the package manager for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).  It
  was created in 2009 as an [open source
  project](https://github.com/npm/npm) to help JavaScript developers
  easily share packaged modules of code.
* The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source
  code for Node.js, [front-end web apps](http://www.ember-cli.com/),
  [mobile apps](http://cordova.apache.org/),
  [robots](https://tessel.io/), [routers](https://linerate.f5.com/),
  and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.
* npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and
  publish those packages.
* npm, Inc. is the company that hosts and maintains all of the above.

## About npm, Inc.

npm, Inc. is a company founded in 2014.  Its executive team is:

- Isaac Z. Schlueter, CEO
- Laurie Voss, COO
- CJ Silverio, CTO

npm, Inc. is dedicated to the long term success of the JavaScript
community, which includes the success of the open-source Node.js and
npm projects.

At npm, Inc. we do three things to support this goal:

1. Run the open source registry as a free service.
2. Build tools and operate services that support the secure use of
   packages in a private or enterprise context.
3. Create [innovative paid products](/features) which enhance the
   lives of professional JavaScript developers around the world.

npm's mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new
places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce
friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical "work hard/play
hard" startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and
interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe
that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of
ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a
sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to
maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision.
Compassion is our strategy.

Our offices are in downtown Oakland, California.
