The options are frequently useful for debugging - see `--help` for a full list:

 - `--skip-push`: don't push to the destination repository - allows manual inspection afterwards
 - `--skip-destination-pull --skip-destination-init`: does not update the destination repository before syncing - allows you to run FBShipIt with the destination repository in a curated state

# Why are files/commits being skipped?

Run with `--verbose` for much more information - for example:

```
$ hhvm shipit_wdt.php --skip-destination-init --skip-destination-pull --skip-push --verbose

# `git-am: patch does not apply` or `already exists in index`

This means that git is unable to use the patch that FBShipIt created.

## General Investigation

Use `--save-patches-to=/some/directory` to save the patches that FBShipIt
creates:

```
$ hhvm shipit_wdt.php --skip-destination-init --skip-destination-pull --skip-push --save-patches-to=/tmp/wdt-github-patches

Finished phase: Initialize source fbsource repository

$ ls /tmp/wdt-github-patches/
24d5ea24f1e6d8485cca6327365f9f2da849dca6.patch

7c2a1e4c0fc7c10973ef1f07a7039fae5d1ac0dc.patch
```

The patches are named after the commit ID in the source repository. You should
be able to reproduce the `git-am` error by applying these
patches by hand, then debug like any other bad-patch issue.

## Common Causes

### File Does Not Exist On GitHub

If the file is meant to be public, commit the file directly to GitHub, with the content that it had before the diff that is blocking the push.

If the file is not meant to be public, modify the `stripPaths` part of your filter so that FBShipIt does not try to apply that part of the patch, and extend your unit test to cover it.

### File On GitHub Does Not Match Internal Copy

If the GitHub version is strictly better, create an internal commit copying the
changes internally, and put `@already-on-github` in the commit message.
One cause of this is people using the 'merge pull request' button on GitHub
instead of merging pull requests to your internal repository.

If the internal version is strictly better, commit an update directly to the GitHub repository.

If both contain changes you want, you will need to merge the two files by hand, using a combination of both approaches.

You can disable the 'merge pull request' button for your project  by sending a
fake unit test result (eg 'no-direct-merges') via the GitHub API, then marking
that unit test as required for merges to master.

# Stalls/lockups when using Mercurial repositories

We use `flock()` for added safety when interacting with Mercurial; to find out
if this is causing problems, try setting the `FBSHIPIT_DEBUG_FLOCK`
environment variable:
