# Node Sass Demo

This app demonstrates using the node-sass-middleware module to serve scss files.

It's based on Ken Wheeler's responsive [Sass demo](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-sass).

It works by writing the compiled files to `/tmp` and then serves it as a static file from there.
