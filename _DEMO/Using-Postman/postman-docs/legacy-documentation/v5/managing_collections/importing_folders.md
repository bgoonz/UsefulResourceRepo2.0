To save a RAML folder as a collection,

1\. Clone the repository containing the RAML definition to your local machine

If you have it saved locally as folder already, that's fine of course.

2\. Open the Postman Import box and hit the Folder tab

You're done! Postman will detect all the RAML definitions and convert them internally to Postman and then show you an import success message.
