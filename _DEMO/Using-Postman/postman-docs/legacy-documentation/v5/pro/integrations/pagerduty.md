PagerDuty is a popular incident management solution that integrates with monitoring stacks for alerting, on-call scheduling, and automatic escalation of critical incidents.

You can configure this service to deliver alerts by text, email, call, or through iOS and Android apps.

You can use this integration to trigger incidents in PagerDuty based on your Postman Monitor results, helping your team investigate and resolve Collection run failures quickly.

To add a team activity feed to PagerDuty:

1. In the PagerDuty integration page, click the **Add Integration** button.
2. In the **Team Activity Feed** page, choose the Monitor you want to send to PagerDuty.
3. Enter your Pagerduty Integration Key and click the **Add Integration** button.

### Viewing PagerDuty results

The PagerDuty console will continuously update to display any incidents that result from your Postman Monitors. If the selected Monitor fails, you’ll receive notifications on PagerDuty according to the formatting and business rules you’ve already set.
