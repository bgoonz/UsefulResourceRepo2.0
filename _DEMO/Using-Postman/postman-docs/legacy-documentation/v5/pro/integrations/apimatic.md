You can use the Postman Pro to APIMATIC Integration to back up your Postman Collections in Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, and other API description formats. <br>

This integration allows APIMATIC to convert your Postman Collections into any major API description format, and save the resulting file into your designated GitHub repository. <br> 

If you don't already have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), you'll need to create one.


### Configuring APIMATIC Integration

1. In the [Integrations page](https://go.postman.co/workspaces), find APIMATIC in the list of Postman’s 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

<ol start="5">
  <li>To back up a collection periodically to a Github repository: 
</li>
</ol>

* Select a collection.
* Select a repository.
* Specify a directory in the repository where you want to add the collection.
* Enter a filename for the directory in the repository.
* Select the format in which you want to save the collection, such as Postman 2.0 or APIMATIC format.
* Specify the branch where you want to add the collection.

<ol start="6">
  <li>Click the <b>Add Integration</b> button. 
</li>
</ol>

APIMATIC converts the collection’s documentation to your format of choice and pushes to your GitHub repository.  Now your Postman collection automatically saves to your GitHub repo every day, in whatever API description format you selected.  API format compatibility is moments away.
