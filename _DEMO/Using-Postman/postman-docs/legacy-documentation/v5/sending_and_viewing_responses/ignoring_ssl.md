**Note:** For the Chrome app, check out [our blog post][1] on this subject.

In the native apps, you have the option of ignoring SSL certificates altogether. If your app complains when you hit a URL with an invalid certificate (when using a different CNAME, for example), you might want to give this a go.

1. Head to the Settings window, and go to the General tab.
2. Change the `SSL certificate verification` setting to Off.
3. Restart the app.
