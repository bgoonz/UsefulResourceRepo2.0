Newman is a command-line collection runner for Postman. It allows you to effortlessly run and test a Postman collection directly from the command-line. It is built with extensibility in mind so that you can easily integrate it with your continuous integration servers and build systems.

Newman maintains feature parity with Postman and allows you to run collections just the way they are executed inside the collection runner in Postman.

Newman resides at the [NPM registry][0] and on [GitHub][1].

### Getting Started

Newman is built on Node.js. To run Newman, make sure you have Node.js installed. Node.js can be downloaded and installed from [here][2] on Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX.

Once Node.js is installed, Newman is just a command away.

    npm install -g newman

This installs Newman from npm globally on your system allowing you to run it from anywhere.

The easiest way to run Newman is to run it with a collection. You can run any collection file lying on your file-system. Refer to the [collection documentation][3] to learn how to use and download collections.

    newman run mycollection.json

You can also pass a Postman Collection as a URL. Your collection probably uses environment variables. To provide an accompanying set of environment variables, [export them from Postman][4] and run them with the `-e` flag.

    newman run https://www.postman.com/collections/cb208e7e64056f5294e5 -e dev_environment.json

### Options

Newman provides a rich set of options to customize a run. A list of options can be retrieved by running it with the `-h` flag.

```
$ newman run -h

Options:

Utility:
-h, --help                      output usage information
-v, --version                   output the version number

Basic setup:
--folder [folderName]           Specify a single folder to run from a collection.
-e, --environment [file|URL]    Specify a Postman environment as a JSON [file]
-d, --data [file]               Specify a data file to use either json or csv
-g, --global [file]             Specify a Postman globals file as JSON [file]
-n, --iteration-count [number]  Define the number of iterations to run

Request options:
--delay-request [number]        Specify a delay (in ms) between requests [number]
--timeout-request [number]      Specify a request timeout (in ms) for a request

Misc.:
--bail                          Stops the runner when a test case fails
--silent                        Disable terminal output
--no-color                      Disable colored output
-k, --insecure                  Disable strict ssl
-x, --suppress-exit-code        Continue running tests even after a failure, but exit with code=0
--ignore-redirects              Disable automatic following of 3XX responses
```

Use the `-n` option to set the number of iterations you want to run the collection for.

    $ newman run mycollection.json -n 10  # runs the collection 10 times

To provide a different set of data, i.e. variables for each iteration, you can use the `-d` to specify a `json` or `csv` file. For example, a data file such as the one shown below will run *2* iterations, with each iteration using a set of variables.

```
[{
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5000",
    "user_id": "1",
    "id": "1",
    "token_id": "123123",
},
{
    "url": "http://postman-echo.com",
    "user_id": "2",
    "id": "2",
    "token_id": "899899",
}]

newman run mycollection.json -d data.json
```

The csv file for the above set of variables would look like

```
url, user_id, id, token_id
http://127.0.0.1:5000, 1, 1, 123123123
http://postman-echo.com, 2, 2, 899899
```

Newman, by default exits with a status code of 0 if everything runs well i.e. without any exceptions. Continuous integration tools respond to these exit codes and correspondingly pass or fail a build. You can use the `--bail` flag to tell Newman to halt on a test case error with a status code of 1 which can then be picked up by a CI tool or build system.

```
$ newman run PostmanCollection.json -e environment.json --bail
newman

  #  failure        detail

 1.  AssertionFai…  response code is 200
                    at assertion:1 in test-script
                    inside "Status Code Test" of "Example Collection with
                    Failing Tests"
```

The results of all tests and requests can be exported into a file and later imported into Postman for further analysis. Use the JSON reporter and a file name to save the runner output into a file.

    newman run mycollection.json --reporters cli,json --reporter-json-export outputfile.json

**NOTE** Newman allows you to use all [libraries and objects][5] that Postman supports to run tests and pre-request scripts.

### File uploads

Newman also supports file uploads. For this to work correctly, the file to be uploaded must be placed in the relative location specified within the collection.
For instance, for the following collection:
```json
{
	"variables": [],
	"info": {
		"name": "file-upload",
		"_postman_id": "9dbfcf22-fdf4-f328-e440-95dbd8e4cfbb",
		"description": "A set of `POST` requests to upload files as form data fields",
		"schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.0.0/collection.json"
	},
	"item": [
		{
			"name": "Form data upload",
			"event": [
				{
					"listen": "test",
					"script": {
						"type": "text/javascript",
						"exec": [
							"var response = JSON.parse(responseBody).files[\"sample-file.txt\"];",
							"",
							"tests[\"Status code is 200\"] = responseCode.code === 200;",
							"tests[\"File was uploaded correctly\"] = /^data:application\\/octet-stream;base64/.test(response);",
							""
						]
					}
				}
			],
			"request": {
				"url": "https://echo.getpostman.com/post",
				"method": "POST",
				"header": [],
				"body": {
					"mode": "formdata",
					"formdata": [
						{
							"key": "file",
							"type": "file",
							"enabled": true,
							"src": "sample-file.txt"
						}
					]
				},
				"description": "Uploads a file as a form data field to `https://echo.getpostman.com/post` via a `POST` request."
			},
			"response": []
		}
	]
}

```
The file `sample-file.txt` must be present in the same directory as the collection. The collection can the be run as usual:

    newman run file-upload.postman_collection.json

### Library

Newman has been built as a library from the ground-up so that it can be extended and put to varied uses. You can use it as follows in your node.js code:

```javascript
var newman = require('newman'); // require newman in your project

// call newman.run to pass `options` object and wait for callback
newman.run({
    collection: require('./sample-collection.json'),
    reporters: 'cli'
}, function (err) {
	if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

### Custom reporters
Custom reporters come in handy when one would want to generate collection run reports that cater to very specific use cases.
For instance, logging out the response body when a request (or it's tests) fail, and so on. 

#### Building custom reporters

A custom reporter is a Node module with a name of the form `newman-reporter-<name>`. To create a custom reporter:
1. Navigate to a directory of your choice, and create a blank npm package with `npm init`.
2. Add an `index.js` file, that exports a function of the following form:
```javascript
function (emitter, reporterOptions, collectionRunOptions) {
  // emitter is is an event emitter that triggers the following events: https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#newmanrunevents
  // reporterOptions is an object of the reporter specific options. See usage examples below for more details.
  // collectionRunOptions is an object of all the collection run options: https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#newmanrunoptions-object--callback-function--run-eventemitter
};
```

3. Publish your reporter using `npm publish`, or use your reporter locally [see usage instructions][7].

Scoped reporter package names like `@myorg/newman-reporter-<name>` are also supported. Working reporter examples can be found in [working reporter examples][8].

#### Using custom reporters
In order to use the custom reporter, it will have to be installed first. For instance, to use the [Newman teamcity reporter][9]:

Install the reporter package. 
```
npm install newman-reporter-teamcity
```

Note that the name of the package is of the form `newman-reporter-<name>`, where `<name>` is the actual name of the reporter. The installation should be global if Newman is installed globally, local otherwise. Run `npm install ...` with the `-g` flag for a global installation.

To use local (non-published) reporters, run the command `npm install <path/to/local-reporter-directory>` instead. 

Use the installed reporter, either via the CLI, or programmatically. Here, the `newman-reporter` prefix is not required while specifying the reporter name in the options.

Scoped reporter packages must be specified with the scope prefix. For instance, if your package name is `@myorg/newman-reporter-name`, you must specify the reporter with `@myorg/name`.

CLI:
```
newman run /path/to/collection.json -r myreporter --reporter-myreporter-<option-name> <option-value> # The option is optional
```

Programmatically:
```javascript
var newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
   collection: '/path/to/collection.json',
   reporters: 'myreporter',
   reporter: {
     myreporter: {
       'option-name': 'option-value' // this is optional
     }
   }
}, function (err, summary) {
  if (err) { throw err; }
  console.info('collection run complete!');
});
```

In both cases above, the reporter options are optional.
