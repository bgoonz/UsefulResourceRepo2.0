**Backup your Postman Collections in Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint and other API Description formats**

Postman is partnering with APIMatic and adding a third-party integration with API Transformer.  The Postman Pro to APIMatic Integration will convert your Postman Collections to any major API description format and save them to GitHub.  

Important: API Transformer uses a GitHub repository to save its documentation.  If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one now.

**Add the APIMatic Integration**

From the [Integrations page][0], select APIMatic from a list of Postman's 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

Click Add to backup your Postman Collections to GitHub, and then log in with your GitHub credentials to authorize Postman to access your GitHub account.

[![Add Integration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/apimatic_add.png)][2]

Select an existing GitHub repository, select an existing Postman Collection and associated Collection settings.

There are also some advanced options available.  You can enter a custom directory name, or leave "Postman Collections" as the default. You can specify a branch for commit, or leave "master" as the default.

Upon submit, APIMatic will convert the Collection's documentation to your format of choice and push to your GitHub repository.

Check it out for yourself!  From now on, your Postman Collection will automatically save to your GitHub repo every day, in whatever API description format you selected.  API format compatibility is just moments away.
