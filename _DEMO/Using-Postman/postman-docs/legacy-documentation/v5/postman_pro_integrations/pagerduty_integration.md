**Trigger and resolve incidents on PagerDuty**

PagerDuty is a popular incident management solution that integrates with monitoring stacks for alerting, on-call scheduling and automatic escalation of critical incidents.  The service can be configured to deliver alerts by phone call, email, text or via iOS and Android apps.
