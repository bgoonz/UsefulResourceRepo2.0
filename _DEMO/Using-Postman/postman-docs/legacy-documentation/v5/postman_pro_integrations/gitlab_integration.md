**Backup your Postman Collections to your GitLab projects**

Backup and synchronize your Postman Collections on GitLab, an open source Git repository manager. Your Collections are all tucked in safe and sound with our latest Postman Pro to GitLab Integration.

**Generate a GitLab Personal Access Token**

[Log in][0] to GitLab. If you don’t already have a Personal Access Token from GitLab, generate a new one [here][1].

Make a note of this token for later.

Enter your GitLab Personal Access Token from earlier.  Select your GitLab Project, select an existing Postman Collection, and then enter a filename to call your backup. Upon submit, your Collection will be pushed to your GitLab project under the filename that you specified, and saved as a single JSON file.

There are also some advanced options available.  You can enter a custom directory name, or leave "Postman Collections" as the default. You can specify a branch for commit, or the default branch of the repository will be used.

And that's it!  From now on, every change saved to your Postman Collection will automatically commit changes to your GitLab project in real time.  Now your Collections and code can live together in perfect harmony in the same repository.
