Jetpacks are an awesome set of features which will make your API workflow faster and more efficient. The goal is to make you write less - or nothing at all - and still be able to execute complex scenarios, that would otherwise take a lot of code or an endless series of clicks in other applications.

You get the following features:

* **Test editor and runner**: Lets you write and run tests within Postman.
* **Pre-request Scripts**: Lets you execute JavaScript code before any request is sent.
* **Collection runner**: Lets you run an entire Postman collection in one go.
* **Data variables**: Lets you parameterise requests with values from a JSON/CSV file. This makes testing multiple scenarios as easy as adding another row
