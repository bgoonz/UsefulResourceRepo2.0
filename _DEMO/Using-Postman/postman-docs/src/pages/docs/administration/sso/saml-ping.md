## Setting up a custom SAML application in Ping Identity

1. From the Ping Identity admin console, select the **Applications** tab.

1. Fill in the required application details and continue to the next step.
   [![ping_details](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/ping_details)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/ping_details)

1. Download the **SAML metadata** file, and enter your Postman service provider details. These details can be found on the Postman [Edit Team Details page](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general).

    | **Field** | **Value** |
    |---|---|
    | Protocol Version | SAML v 2.0 |
    | Assertion Consumer Service | *collect it from the Postman team details page* |
    | Entity ID | *collect it from the Postman team details page* |

    Leave the remaining fields blank or with the default value, and continue to the next step.

1. Once the setup is completed, submit your Identity Provider's details to Postman. Copy the `Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL`, `Identity Provider Issuer`, and `X.509 Certificate` from the downloaded **SAML metadata** file and enter these values on the Postman [Edit Team Details page](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) within the **Ping Identity Provider Details** modal.
