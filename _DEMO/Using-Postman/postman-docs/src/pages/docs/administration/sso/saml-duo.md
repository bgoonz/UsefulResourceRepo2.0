## Setting up a custom SAML application in Duo

1. Enter `Postman` as the service provider. The service provider details can be found on the Postman [Edit Team Details page](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general). Other fields can either be left blank or set to the default value.

     | **Field** | **Value** |
     |---|---|
     | Service Provider Name | Postman |
     | Entity ID | *collect it from the Postman team details page* |
     | Assertion Consumer Service | *collect it from the Postman team details page* |
     | NameID format | EmailAddress |

1. After configuring the service provider details, click the **Save Configuration** button.

1. Duo requires your cloud application to be added to the Duo Access Gateway. Refer to this [guide for setting this up](https://duo.com/docs/dag-generic).

1. Once the setup is complete, submit your Identity Provider's details to Postman. Collect the `Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL`, `Identity Provider Issuer`, and `X.509 Certificate` from the Duo configuration page and fill these values in your Postman [Edit Team Details page](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) within the **Duo Identity Provider Details** modal. For more details on this last step, review [setting up SSO in Postman](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/).
