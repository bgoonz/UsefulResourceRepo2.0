## Editing your team profile

When you select **Team Settings**, you will be automatically directed to **Edit Profile**. Here, you can edit your team's logo, cover photo, URL, name, and favicon.

> Logos and cover photos must be 500KB or smaller in size and only .jpg, .jpeg, and .png files are accepted.
<!-- -->
> Logos must have a 1:1 aspect ratio and cover photos must have a 1:7.5 (height:width) aspect ratio. If your image does not fit these requirements, Postman will prompt you to select a portion of your image to upload.

You can also opt to enable your team's public profile. If you enable this feature, your team's profile will show up on Postman's [API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/adding-private-network/), along with any [APIs](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/adding-private-network/#adding-your-apis), [collections](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/), and [workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-workspaces/) your team has published. You can also add an **About your team** section, a link to your website, and links to social media accounts to your team's public profile.

## Making your team discoverable

You can select **Team Discovery** from the left-hand menu to view your options for making your team discoverable to other Postman users with email addresses from your team's domain.

See [Team Discovery](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/#team-discovery) for more information on this feature and the admin and user experience it provides.
