You can use a variety of Postman developer resources in your projects, including APIs and libraries. You can use and contribute to Postman's [open source](https://www.postman.com/open-philosophy/) projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/postmanlabs).

Check out the pages in this section for an intro to developer resources that allow you to engage with the Postman community and integrate Postman into your workflow.

* [**Postman API**](/docs/developer/intro-api/)
    * Make requests to access your Postman data.
* [**Echo API**](/docs/developer/echo-api/)
    * Use the Echo API to learn and experiment with Postman.
* [**Collections SDK**](/docs/developer/collection-sdk/)
    * The Collections SDK is a JavaScript module for working with Postman [collections](/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/).
* [**Runtime library**](/docs/developer/runtime-library/)
    * The Runtime library powers Postman request sending functionality.
* [**Code generators**](/docs/developer/code-generators/)
    * Postman uses the code generators SDK to create client snippets from your requests.
* [**Postman collection converters**](/docs/developer/collection-conversion/)
    * The converters allow you to transform OpenAPI, Swagger, RAML, and GraphQL specs to Postman collection format.

> You can use the __Postman CLI [Newman](/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/)__ in conjunction with other utilities to build collection runs into your development pipeline. Newman is also an [open source project](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) that you can use and contribute to.
