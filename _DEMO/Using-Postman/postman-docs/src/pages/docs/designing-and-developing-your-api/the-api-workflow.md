You can design your API directly in Postman using the API Builder. By defining your schema in __APIs__ on the left of Postman, your specification can act as the single source of truth for your API project. The API Builder supports API-first development by allowing you to generate collections from your schema and build your development and testing from there.

[![API Builder](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-api-builder-overview2-v2.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-api-builder-overview2-v2.jpg)

You can connect various components of your API development and testing process to your schema, such as collections, documentation, tests, mocks, and monitors. You can also version your APIs in Postman and connect elements to specific versions.

## Creating an API

To access the API Builder, open __APIs__ from the left sidebar in Postman. You can open and edit any existing APIs from here—Postman will automatically open the most recent version of an API by default.

<img alt="Create API" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-create-new-api2.jpg"/>

Click __New__, then select __API__ or click __+__.

> You must be signed in to your Postman account to take this action.

![New API](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-create-api-modal2.jpg)

Enter a name and a version, then select a schema type and format for your API. You can optionally import an API specification directly at this stage—if you don't, Postman will populate your API with a sample specification you can edit at any time.

> Postman currently supports OpenAPI (versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0), RAML (0.8 and 1.0), and GraphQL. Your schema can be defined in JSON, YAML, XML, or GraphQL SDL. Multi-file variants of schemas are currently not supported.

You can rename, delete, or remove the API from the workspace using the __View more actions__ (__...__) menu in the left sidebar.

> When you delete an API or remove it from a workspace, the collections, monitors, mocks, and environments linked to it will not be deleted / removed.

<img alt="Edit API" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-more-actions2.jpg"/>

You can also [version your APIs](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/versioning-an-api/).

## Defining an API

You can define the structure of your API using its specification. You can also generate a collection from a spec.

* [Editing your schema](#editing-your-schema)
* [Generating a collection](#generating-a-collection)

> You can also [sync an API spec from a GitHub repository](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/github/#syncing-your-api-schemas-on-github).

### Editing your schema

The __Define__ tab in your API will include a specification (either one you imported or a sample Postman added when you created the API).

The default schema format is Open API 3.0, with YAML as the default language. To use a different schema type or language, choose it from the drop-down list.

The left pane of the schema editor displays an outline of your schema. When you first open the editor, the top level of nodes will be expanded, and the rest of them collapsed. Click nodes to expand or collapse them. Click an element in the outline to jump to it in the editor. You can also click the outline button to hide or show the outline.

![Schema navigation](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-api-builder-schema-outline.gif)

In the schema editor, when you hover over a '#ref' component and press the Command key, a popover displays the first 200 characters of the reference component. When you Command-click the reference component, it will jump to the reference location.

![Schema refs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-api-builder-ref-jump.jpg)

In the upper right of the schema editor are options to beautify the content, wrap text, copy, and search. When you finish editing your schema, click **Save**.

![Save Schema](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-wrap-text2-v2.jpg)

> Postman will indicate [validation errors](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/validating-elements-against-schema/) as you work on your schema.

### Generating a collection

The Postman API Builder supports API-first development by providing the option to create a Postman collection directly from a schema. Once you have a saved schema, you will see a **Generate Collection** option on the right-hand side of the tabs:

![Schema Editor Options](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-generate-collection-button2-v2.jpg)

To create a collection based on your schema, click **Generate Collection**. You can add the collection as documentation, a test suite, an integration test, a monitor, a mock server, or a contract test. The collection will appear in __Collections__ in the left sidebar.

![Generate Collection](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-generate-collection-modal2.jpg)

You can also configure how the collection should be generated by clicking **Show advanced settings**.

## Watching an API

The watch option allows you to receive an email/in-app notification when a team member belonging to the same workspace modifies the API for example updating the schema, attaching an element to the API, adding a comment to the API and so on.

Once you've created the API, click the __watch__ option to start watching the API.

![Watch Option](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-watch-button2.jpg)

Click the bell icon on the top right corner to view the notification. The popup will indicate further information about the change that was made to the API.

![Notification Watch API](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-watch-notification2.jpg)

In addition to this, you will receive an email with the information regarding who has made the change, what the change was, and when it was made.

![Email Notification](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v8-email-watch-email2.jpg)

Click __View schema changelog__ to access the full changelog or __View API__ to view the API in Postman.

> You will not receive notifications for changes made by yourself.

## Developing an API

Once you have a schema in the Postman API Builder, you can develop your API using version tagging, and link it to mock servers, documentation, and environments.

> When you add documentation, test suites, mocks, monitors, and environments, only the elements in the current workspace will be visible. If an element is already linked to an API, it will not be visible.
