[Public workspaces](https://blog.postman.com/public-workspaces-why-we-created-them-what-you-can-do/) enable you to collaborate on entities with anyone across the world. Before you create a public workspace, navigate to your [team profile settings](https://postman.postman.co/settings/team/general) and enable your public team profile. This will ensure your team's profile will show up on the [Public API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore).

## Creating a public workspace

There are four types of workspaces - personal, team, private, and public workspaces. When you open a workspace, Postman will provide an overview of its contents, activity, and members in a new tab.

Open the workspace menu, then click **+ New Workspace**.

<img alt="New workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/create-new-workspace-v8.jpg" width="400px"/>

Specify a workspace name and summary.

If you are on a Postman **Team** or **Free** plan, you can create a public workspace by changing the workspace's visibility to **Public**. Add collaborators by entering their email addresses, then define their [workspace roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles).

> You need to be a [__workspace admin__](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) to change the visibility of a workspace to public.

<img alt="Public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/create-public-workspace-v8.jpg" height="500px"/>

You can also create a public workspace by selecting the team workspace, changing the team's visibility dropdown to __Public__, then clicking __Request to Change Visibility__.

<img alt="Visibility" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/visibility-options-v8.jpg" width="400px"/>

If you are on a Postman **Business** or **Enterprise** plan, you need a community manager's approval to change the workspace visibility to __Public__.

Once you make a workspace public, a notification is sent to workspace members. Click the notification bell in the top right corner to view notifications.

<img alt="In app notification" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/visibility-app-notification.jpg" width="500px"/>

In addition to this, all users will receive an email with the workspace information regarding who has made the change and which workspace was affected. The email will also provide a direct link to the workspace.

<img alt="Email notification" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/email-notification-public-workspace-v2.jpg" width="500px"/>

Once you make a workspace public, all entities within that workspace become publicly accessible through the workspace. You can convert a private workspace directly to public.

> Within a team, you cannot have two public workspaces with the same name.

## Accessing a public workspace

You can access public workspaces via the [**Workspaces** category in the API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore/workspaces). You can also access personal, team, and private workspaces using the workspace selector at the top of Postman.

[![Access Public Workspaces](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/accessing-public-workspaces.gif)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/accessing-public-workspaces.gif)

To view and edit your public workspace details (e.g. name, description), navigate to the workspace selector and hover over a workspace. Then, click **...** and select **View**.

<img alt="Create public workspace dropdown" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/create-public-workspace-dropdown.jpg" height="350px"/>

## Sharing a public workspace

You can share a public workspace by sharing its **public profile URL** directly. To access the public profile URL, navigate to your **Team**, then click **Team Settings**.

<img alt="View team settings" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/view-team-settings-for-public-profile.jpg" height="400px"/>

Copy the **Public profile URL** and paste it in your browser to access your workspace.

<img alt="Enable public profile url" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/enable-public-profile-url.jpg"/>

## Joining a public workspace

If you are part of a team in Postman, you can find public workspaces to join. Open the workspaces drop-down from the control at the top of Postman in the left. Search for a public workspace and select the workspace you want to join.

<img alt="Joining a public workspace overview" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/join-public-workspace-from-selector.jpg" height="350px"/>

Select the public workspace, then click **Join Workspace** at the top right.

<img alt="Join public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/join-public-workspace-from-overview-v8.jpg"/>

Once you join the workspace, you can start creating collections, sending requests, visualizing your responses, and more.

## Leaving a public workspace

To leave a public workspace, select the **...** on the right corner of the workspace overview > **Leave workspace**. Click **Leave** to finalize leaving the workspace.

<img alt="Leave public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/leaving-public-workspace.jpg"/>

## Adding elements to a public workspace

You can add existing collections and environments to another public workspace by sharing them.

To share a collection to a public workspace, open it via Collections on the left-hand side, click **...** > **Share collection**.

<img alt="Adding an collection to public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/share-collection-public-workspace.jpg" height="500px"/>

To share an environment, open it via Environments on the left-hand side, click **...** > **Share environment**.

<img alt="Adding an environment to public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/share-environment-public-workspace.jpg" height="400px"/>

Select the public workspace you want to share to, and choose whether you also want to remove the element from its current workspace. Click **Share and Continue**.

<img alt="Share element to public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/share-element-to-public-workspace.jpg" height="400px"/>

## Removing elements from a public workspace

When you remove an element from a public workspace, it is no longer visible in that particular workspace. The element is still available in any other workspace where it has been added.

From Postman, you can remove a collection from the sidebar. Click **...** to open the collection menu. Select **Remove from workspace** and confirm that you would like to remove the collection from the current workspace. The collection will no longer be visible in the workspace.

<img alt="Removing a collection to public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/remove-collection-public-workspace.jpg" height="500px"/>

To remove an environment from the sidebar, click **...** next to the environment menu or click **...** next to the Share button in the Environment tab. Select **Remove from workspace** and confirm that you would like to remove the environment from the current workspace. The environment will no longer be visible in the workspace.

<img alt="Removing an environment to public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/remove-environment-public-workspace.jpg"/>

> Note that deleting an element is different to removing it. When you delete an element it is no longer available in any workspace. When you remove an element from a specific workspace, it will still be available in any other workspaces it was in.

## Deleting a public workspace

Public workspaces must have their visibility reverted in order to be deleted. If you try to delete a public workspace by clicking **...** on the right corner of the workspace overview, the option to delete will be greyed out.

<img alt="Deleting a public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/delete-option-greyed-public-workspace.jpg"/>

To change the visibility of a public workspace, change the visibility dropdown to **Team**, then **Save Changes**. After changing the visibility, you will be able to delete the workspace. Click **...** > **Delete workspace**.

## Managing public workspace members

If you're a team administrator you can add or remove any member from your public workspace via the **Members** tab. To add members to a public workspace, see [Inviting to team workspaces](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#inviting-to-team-workspaces).

Another way to add workspace members is to click **Manage Team** and select **Invite Users**.

<img alt="add workspace members public workspace (2)" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/manage-team-v8.jpg"/>

Enter an email address, click **Add** to the team, select the roles you would like to assign to them, then select **Send Invitations**. You can also generate a link and invite people to your team by sharing the link with them.

<img alt="Edit members for a public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/edit-member-public-workspace.jpg"/>

> Team members will receive an email and in-app notification when added to a public workspace.

To remove any team member, click the trash icon next to the individual you want to remove from the workspace, and select **Remove User From Team**.

<img alt="Remove team members for a public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/remove-member-public-workspace.jpg"/>

Click **X** next to the team member you want to remove from the public workspace, and click **Save**.
