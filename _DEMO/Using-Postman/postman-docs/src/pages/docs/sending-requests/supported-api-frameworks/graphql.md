Many people think of Postman as an advanced REST client. Beyond REST, Postman is a tool that handles any calls sent over HTTP. This means that you can use Postman to interact with protocol-agnostic APIs - such as [SOAP](/docs/sending-requests/supported-api-frameworks/making-soap-requests/) and GraphQL, which can both utilize HTTP, just like REST.

Learn how Postman supports working with GraphQL.

* Sending GraphQL queries in request body as POST requests
* Support for GraphQL variables
* Creating APIs in Postman with GraphQL schema type
* Query autocompletion integrated with user defined GraphQL schemas

Try it out in Postman with this [example template](https://explore.postman.com/templates/1692/working-with-graphql).

There's a few ways for you to author and send a GraphQL query in Postman. The following screen illustrates one way to send a GraphQL query using Postman's inbuilt support.

[![graphql body](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/GraphQL-Body.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/GraphQL-Body.png)

Under the **Body** tab, select the **GraphQL** body type. Enter your GraphQL query in the **Query** editor. This editor enables you to author both queries and variables separately, as described in the following section.

## Working with GraphQL variables

Postman provides a separate interface to author GraphQL variables. After defining your GraphQL query in the **Query** editor, you can author and edit GraphQL variables in the adjacent variables editor.

You can also [use Postman variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/) as data inputs for GraphQL variables using `{{variable}}` syntax.

## Importing GraphQL schemas

To [create or import a GraphQL schemas](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/) into Postman, complete the following steps.

1. Under the **APIs** tab, click **+ New API**, navigate to the **Define** tab, and then select **Create new** or **Import file**.

1. Choose **GraphQL** from the dropdown, and click **Save**.

## Autocomplete for GraphQL

Once you create or import a GraphQL schema as described above, you can enable autocompletion within the **GraphQL** query editor.

1. Under the **Collections** tab, return to your **GraphQL** body. Select your schema from the dropdown. You may need to refresh by clicking on the adjacent icon.

1. Begin editing your query, and now Postman will suggest autocomplete options from the data within your GraphQL schema.
