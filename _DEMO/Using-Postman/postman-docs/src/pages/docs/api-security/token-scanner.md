The Postman Token Scanner scans your public workspaces, collections, environments, and documentation to find accidentally exposed tokens. This protects your organization and prevents malicious users from exploiting the tokens.

> Token Scanner is available only on the [Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) and is enabled by default.

## Use cases

A scan is triggered whenever your team members do any of the following actions:

* Share a collection or environment to a public workspace.
* Make changes to a collection or environment that is present in a public workspace.
