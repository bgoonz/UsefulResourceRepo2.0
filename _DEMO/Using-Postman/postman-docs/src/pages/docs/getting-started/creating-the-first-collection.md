Postman Collections are a group of saved requests you can organize into folders.

Every request you send in Postman appears under the **History** tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing requests through the history section is convenient. However, as your Postman usage scales, it can be time consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead of combing through your history section, you can save all your requests as a group for easier access.

Let's review how to [send a basic request](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) and create a new collection.

## Creating your first collection

You can create a new request from the left sidebar in Postman. Click __New__ &gt; __Request__.

To create a new request from the Overview tab, use the Get started section at the right of Postman and click Create a request.

Enter a request in the request builder and click **Save** to open the **SAVE REQUEST** modal.

* As an optional step, enter a new request name. Otherwise, the default name will be the request URL.
* As an optional step, enter a request description in plain text or using [Markdown](https://documenter.postman.com/view/33232/markdown-in-api-documentation/JsGc?version=latest).

Save this request to an existing collection, or create a new collection by entering a collection name, and then click the **Save** button.

Congratulations! You can see all of your collections under the **Collections** tab of the sidebar on the left, as illustrated in the screen below:
