Microsoft Power Automate enables you to automate workflows between your favorite apps and services to get notifications, synchronize files, collect data, and more. It offers over 140 services with predefined flows available for easy implementation.

You can configure Microsoft Power Automate with Postman to monitor run results, view team and collection-specific activity feeds, back up your Postman Collections, and use a Microsoft Power Automate Webhook URL.

## Configuring Microsoft Power Automate Integration

1. Select **[Home](https://go.postman.co/home)**.

    ![postman home page](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/msflow-home.jpg)

1. Select **[Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations)**.

    ![postman home page](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/msflow-integrations.jpg)
1. Search and select **Microsoft Power Automate**.

## Add a team activity feed to Microsoft Power Automate

The activity feed is where you can track changes made to your collections and within your team. Integrating with Microsoft Power Automate gives you the freedom to connect email services like Outlook, Gmail, or a custom SMTP service. You also have the option to set up Twilio to text you when updates are made to your feed.

To add a team activity feed to Microsoft Power Automate:

1. Select **Add Integration**.
1. On the **Team Activity Feed** page, enter the Webhook URL to send team updates to this specific URL.
1. Select **Add Integration**.

## Back up your Postman Collections in Microsoft Power Automate

It’s important to back up your Postman Collections for safekeeping. Microsoft Power Automate helps you do this with services like Box (a cloud-based storage solution), but you can also use it to backup to your custom DB2 instance.

To back up your Postman Collections in Microsoft Power Automate:

1. Select **Add Integration**.
1. On the **Backup your Postman Collections** page:
   * Select the collection.
   * Enter the notification URL.
   * Enter an identifier for this integration.
1. Select **Add Integration**.

## See collection activity feed in Microsoft Power Automate

The activity feed is where you can view all of the changes being made to your Postman Collection by your teammates. Integrating with Microsoft Power Automate gives you the freedom to connect email services like Outlook, Gmail, or a custom SMTP service. You also have the option to set up Twilio to text you when updates are made to your feed.

To see collection activity feed in Microsoft Power Automate:

1. Select **Add Integration**.
2. On the **Team Activity Feed** page, enter the Webhook URL to send team updates to this specific URL.
3. Select **Add Integration**.

## Send Monitor run results in Microsoft Power Automate

Postman Monitors enable you to run your collections on a schedule without any manual intervention. With the Microsoft Power Automate integration, you can use those results by connecting to other available services.

To send monitor run results to Microsoft Power Automate:

1. Select **Add Integration**.
1. On the **Monitor Run Results** page, select the monitor you want to send to Microsoft Power Automate.
1. Select **Add Integration**.

![microsoft_mon_runs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/msflows-post-monitoring-res.jpg)

You can also configure advanced options to alert you when a monitor run completes or when three failures occur and the first monitor run after those failures completes successfully.

Your integration has been set up successfully. Now, whenever a monitor runs, you should get a notification on your Microsoft Power Automate mobile app.

## Get the Microsoft Power Automate webhook URL

Log in to [Microsoft Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/), and go to `My Flows`. Select `Create from Blank` in the top-right corner.

Once that is done, select `New Step → Add an Action` and configure your specific service. For this demo, let's connect your Postman Monitor to the Microsoft Power Automate mobile app. So, on every Monitor run, you will receive an in-app notification in the Microsoft Power Automate mobile app. Select `Notifications` from the list of services and choose the `Send me a mobile notification` action.

![add action](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/58858298.jpg)

![notifications](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/58858309.jpg)

You can customize the text notifications by choosing your wording and adding content derived from your Postman Monitor run results.

![enter text](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/58858318.jpg)

Once this is done, select `Create Flow` on the top-right corner. Once your flow has been created, you will need the webhook URL generated by Microsoft Power Automate. To obtain that, select `Request` and you will see the generated webhook URL.
