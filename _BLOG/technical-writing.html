        How Google’s Technical Writing Course Helped Me Become a Better Writer
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Google has a technical writing course that I recently completed and highly
      enjoyed. It takes roughly 4 hours, and has some exercises along the way so
      you can test yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m going to briefly explain what I learned from completing the course,
      and I’ll summarise the best bits so you can get a good overview of what’s
      covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ll go over some grammar rules and linguistics for the English language,
      but I’ll explain everything upfront so we’re all on the same page. The
      only thing you need to complete the course is a “little writing
      proficiency in English”, but “you don’t have to be a strong writer”.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s dive in.</p>
    <p>Let’s define some terms we are going to use throughout this document:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Nouns</strong> are used to name something such as
        <strong>Mrs Kay</strong>, <strong>Eiffel Tower</strong> or
        <strong>manager</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pronouns</strong> are used instead of a noun such as
        <strong>I</strong>, <strong>you</strong>, <strong>we</strong>,
        <strong>them</strong>, <strong>he</strong>, or <strong>it</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adjectives</strong> are used to describe nouns such as
        <strong>friendly</strong> Mrs Kay, the <strong>rusty</strong> Eiffel
        Tower or the <strong>good</strong> manager.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Verbs</strong> are doing words such as <strong>fight</strong>,
        <strong>run</strong>, <strong>type</strong> and <strong>eat</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adverbs</strong> describe verbs such as
        <strong>strongly</strong> fight, <strong>cowardly</strong> run,
        <strong>aggressively</strong> type and <strong>timidly</strong> eat.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Clarity describes how clear your point is in your writing. Your number one
      priority in technical writing is clarity.
    </p>
    <h3 id="pronoun-use">Pronoun use</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever you use pronouns, make sure they are clear. It’s easy to get
      confused. Something like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        C++ is a pretty old language, but JavaScript is old too. I really like
        it though.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Huh? You like what? C++ or JavaScript? The <strong>pronouns</strong> used
      here don’t help the clarity.
    </p>
    <p>Clarify pronouns usage like:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        C++ is a pretty old language, but JavaScript is old too. I really like
        C++.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Generally, when proof reading, if it’s unclear to what you’re referring,
      use the noun instead of the pronoun. <strong>This</strong> or
      <strong>that</strong> are especially prone to this issue. Make sure
      whenever you use these words it’s clear what is being discussed.
    </p>
    <h3 id="idioms">Idioms</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Idioms</strong> are common phrases used to describe something. But
      some idioms mean nothing to an international audience. Because
      <strong>idioms</strong> are so specific to your region/language, try to
      avoid them in your technical writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one understands what
      <strong>walking around the porridge, chewing the fat</strong>, or
      <strong>inflating a cow</strong> means intuitively. Just say exactly what
      you mean, and try to keep your analogies simple and idiom free.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Succinctness</strong> is how brief and clearly expressed your
      writing is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good software engineers spend as much time deleting code as writing it
      when polishing their work. It’s the same in writing. Shorter code
      generally:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Makes it easier for others to read</li>
      <li>Makes code easier to maintain</li>
      <li>Extra lines of code add extra points of failure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of these points also apply to your technical writing.</p>
    <p>
      Sometimes polishing and saying what you want to say
      <strong>succinctly</strong> takes time, and you have to really craft the
      document. You might even end up proof reading multiple times – but it is
      worthwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shorter sentences also encourage readers to continue reading. How
      intimidating is one huge paragraph? It can sometimes intimidate readers,
      and some readers will just bounce straight off your page when they see
      huge 1,000 word paragraphs.
    </p>
    <h3 id="remove-there-is-and-there-are">
      Remove “there is” and “there are”
    </h3>
    <p>
      As you go through your writing, “<strong>there is</strong>” and “<strong
        >there are</strong
      >” can almost always be removed to more briefly express your point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both terms are generally very generic and bore readers. Rework the
      sentence. Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a lot of overlap between software and hardware.</li>
      <li>There are not multiple threads in JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope you agree how much better these now read:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Software and hardware have a lot of overlap.</li>
      <li>JavaScript does not have multiple threads.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="minimise-use-of-adjectives-and-adverbs">
      Minimise use of adjectives and adverbs
    </h3>
    <p>
      Adjectives and adverbs are used a lot in descriptive, creative writing
      like fiction and poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google’s example is turning “<strong>grass</strong>” into “<strong
        >verdant, prodigal grass</strong
      >” or turning the lifeless-sounding “<strong>hair</strong>” into “<strong
        >silky, flowing hair</strong
      >”
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble is that <strong>adverbs</strong> and
      <strong>adjectives</strong> are generally too loosely defined, and they
      can also make your technical writing sound like marketing.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Running the code in production mode makes the code run screamingly fast.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As opposed to:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Running the code in production mode will result in a 225% performance
        gain.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I hope you agree the second is more precise and quantifiable.</p>
    <h3 id="make-use-of-lists">Make use of lists</h3>
    <p>
      When you have a long sentence with lots of elements in it, you should
      split it up into a list. For example, if you’re listing the benefits of a
      particular technology, you could say, X is a great choice because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It’s lightweight</li>
      <li>It’s fast</li>
      <li>It’s easy to use</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While this is a simple example, you get the idea. This is now far more
      readable than an overly long sentence and you won’t lose readers or your
      flow.
    </p>
    <h3 id="use-the-right-list">Use the right list</h3>
    <p>
      If you do find a good place to use a list, it’s important to use the right
      list. You could use either a numbered list, like this:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Here’s my numbered list</li>
      <li>Isn’t it pretty?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Or you can use a bulleted list, like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Here’s my bulleted list</li>
      <li>Different, but still cool</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>So which one should you use?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Use a <strong>numbered list</strong>, where the order matters, like say a
      recipe. Try to start each number with a commanding verb to reinforce the
      step by step instructions of the list, too:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Turn on the oven.</li>
      <li>Bake the cake.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Bulleted lists</strong> work well for everything else.</p>
    <h3 id="keep-your-lists-parallel">Keep your lists parallel</h3>
    <p>
      Now you’re hopefully using the right lists! The next step to help you use
      lists to their maximum potential is to keep them
      <strong>parallel</strong>. What does that mean?
    </p>
    <p>Your list items should all have the same:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grammar and punctuation</li>
      <li>
        Logical categorisation (the list items reasonably all belong together)
      </li>
      <li>Capitalisation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s provide a bad example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>c++</li>
      <li>JAVASCRIPT?</li>
      <li>Rust!</li>
      <li>chocolate chip cookies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of the above rules have been broken. The item “chocolate chip cookies”
      doesn’t logically belong in the list, the capitalisation/casing of each
      element is different, and the punctuation isn’t consistently applied (It’s
      not clear why “JAVASCRIPT” ends in a “?”, and “Rust” with an “!”)
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentences are generally made up of <strong>subject</strong>,
      <strong>object</strong> and <strong>verb</strong>. Let’s do a few as a
      test:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I wrote a story.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>I</strong> am the subject, <strong>story</strong> is the object,
      and <strong>wrote</strong> is the verb.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I really admire Jake’s work</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>I</strong> am the subject, <strong>Jake</strong> is the object and
      <strong>admire</strong> is the verb.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The subject is the one doing the thing.</li>
      <li>The object is the thing being done to.</li>
      <li>The verb is what is being done to the object by the subject.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of the above examples use <strong>active voice</strong> because the
      subject does the verb to the object. So let’s flip those above examples to
      <strong>passive voice</strong>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The story was written by me</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Jake’s work has my admiration <em>(or Jake’s work is admired by me)</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You should use <strong>active voice</strong> because, in addition to being
      more powerful and direct:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It’s much easier to understand. Whenever people read the
        <strong>passive voice</strong> they have to make the mental effort to
        transfer <strong>passive voice</strong> to
        <strong>active voice.</strong> So for ease of reading, skip that step
        and write in the <strong>active voice</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Active voice</strong> is far more familiar to the reader, as we
        read active voice writing most of the time
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Passive voice</strong> sometimes forces the reader to guess who
        did what in the sentence and obscures the meaning
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Active voice</strong> is generally shorter than passive voice.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Let’s look at how to maximise each component of a well crafted written
      piece.
    </p>
    <h3 id="sentences">Sentences</h3>
    <p>
      Developers are familiar with keeping their code single responsibility.
      Keep the same formula in mind for sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Express one idea clearly and briefly, before moving onto the next
      sentence. Don’t have lots of <strong>and also this</strong> and
      <strong>that too</strong> and
      <strong>even further splitting on our final sentence</strong>. If you end
      up doing that, split each text after the <strong>and</strong> into its own
      sentence.
    </p>
    <h3 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3>
    <p>
      Paragraphs should have a clear opening sentence to explain the paragraph’s
      central point.
    </p>
    <p>You also should clearly answer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What are you trying to convey?</li>
      <li>Why is it important?</li>
      <li>How should the reader use this knowledge?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s have an example that does all the above:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The <code>garp()</code> function returns the delta between a dataset’s
        mean and median. Many people believe unquestioningly that a mean always
        holds the truth. However, a mean is easily influenced by a few very
        large or very small data points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Call <code>garp()</code> to help determine whether a few very large or
        very small data points are influencing the mean too much. A relatively
        small <code>garp()</code> value suggests that the mean is more
        meaningful than when the <code>garp()</code> value is relatively high.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="jargon-and-context">Jargon and context</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Jargon</strong> is the specialised terminology that a particular
      field uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Investors might talk about a <strong>W8-BEN</strong> form or
      <strong>SPAC</strong>s. But if you’re outside that field, you have no clue
      what’s being discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where possible, remove all jargon and acronyms and briefly explain what
      something is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to make your writing as plain and simple as possible, still giving due
      credit to the complexity of what you’re discussing (don’t oversimplify!).
      If your writing is difficult or complex to understand, it won’t help
      anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t assume knowledge either. If you want to talk about something, either
      explain it, or try to link to a good resource on it. Some refer to this as
      the <strong>Curse of Knowledge</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assume your reader knows less than you, so experienced readers can just
      skim the parts they already know, and newbies don’t get lost.
    </p>
    <h3 id="word-choice">Word choice</h3>
    <p>
      English is the dominant language for technical writing, but English is not
      always the first language of the reader. Try to stick to commonly used,
      simple English words.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don’t have to discuss the <strong>exuberance</strong> you find from
      <strong>polysyllabic</strong> words, flaunting your
      <strong>magniloquence</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="write-an-introduction">Write an Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      When you write something, briefly explain at the beginning what you’re
      going to cover. This can help people understand exactly what you’re
      discussing before reading more.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tailor-your-contents-to-your-audience">
      Tailor your Contents to your Audience
    </h3>
    <p>
      Try and fit your document to your audience. When you write on
      <a href="https://dev.to/">dev.to</a> you may write one way, and when you
      write on freeCodeCamp News you might write another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compose your document to best suit the audience. For example, if you’re
      explaining your company’s architecture to a wider audience, you will have
      to explain things more thoroughly as there’s less shared knowledge there
      than with your colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime you may not even be writing for technical people, and you’ll need
      to explain things in a less-complex way to aid their understanding.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s do a brief overview of what we covered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Try to be consistent through your writing</li>
      <li>Avoid ambiguous pronouns</li>
      <li>Prefer active voice</li>
      <li>Be succinct.</li>
      <li>Focus each sentence on one idea</li>
      <li>Make use of lists</li>
      <li>Focus on deleting unnecessary words</li>
      <li>Don’t use complex English or jargon</li>
      <li>Keep lists parallel</li>
      <li>Open paragraphs with an overview of what you’re covering</li>
      <li>Scope your document to your audience.</li>
      <li>Establish your key points at the start of your writing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I hope this article has explained some helpful concepts Google taught me
      when I completed their technical writing course.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am going to try and pick and choose the relevant parts of their advice
      as and when it applies to the writing I do, and I hope it helps you too. I
      found quite a few helpful rules here for me to apply to documentation or
      any technical writing I produce.
