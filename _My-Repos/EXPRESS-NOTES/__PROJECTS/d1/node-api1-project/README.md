# Node API 1 Project Starter Code

## Introduction

- Building a RESTful API.
- Performing CRUD operations.
- Writing API endpoints.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Setup

There are two possible ways to submit your project. Your instructor should have communicated which method to use for this project during the Guided Project and in your cohort's Slack channel. If you are still unsure, reach out to Lambda Staff.

#### Option A - Codegrade

- [x] Fork and clone the repository.
- [x] Open the assignment in Canvas and click on the "Set up git" option.
- [x] Follow instructions to set up Codegrade's Webhook and Deploy Key.
- [x] Push your first commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "first commit" && git push`.
- [x] Check to see that Codegrade has accepted your git submission.

#### Option B - Pull Request

- [x] Fork and clone the repository.
- [x] Implement your project in a `firstname-lastname` branch.
- [x] Create a pull request of `firstname-lastname` against your `main` branch.
- [x] Open the assignment in Canvas and submit your pull request.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Use Node.js and Express to build an API that performs CRUD operations on users.

- Add a `server` script to the `package.json` that runs the API using `nodemon`.

### Write endpoints

Add the code necessary in `index.js` and `api/server.js` to create a Web API and implement the following _endpoints_:

| Method | URL            | Description                                                                                            |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | /api/users     | Creates a user using the information sent inside the `request body`.                                   |
| GET    | /api/users     | Returns an array users.                                                                                |
| GET    | /api/users/:id | Returns the user object with the specified `id`.                                                       |
| DELETE | /api/users/:id | Removes the user with the specified `id` and returns the deleted user.                                 |
| PUT    | /api/users/:id | Updates the user with the specified `id` using data from the `request body`. Returns the modified user |

#### User Schema

Each User _resource_ should conform to the following structure (AKA schema):

```js
{
  id: "a_unique_id", // String, required
  name: "Jane Doe",  // String, required
  bio: "Having fun", // String, required
}
```

#### Database Access Functions

You can find them inside `api/users/model.js`. All of these functions return Promises.

- `find` Resolves to the list of users (or empty array).
- `findById` Takes an `id` and resolves to the user with that id (or null if the id does not exist).
- `insert` Takes a new user `{ name, bio }` and resolves to the the newly created user `{ id, name, bio }`.
- `update` Takes an `id` and an existing user `{ name, bio }` and resolves the updated user `{ id, name, bio}` (or null if the id does not exist).
- `remove` Takes an `id` and resolves to the deleted user `{ id, name, bio }`.

#### Endpoint Specifications

When the client makes a `POST` request to `/api/users`:

- If the request body is missing the `name` or `bio` property:

  - respond with HTTP status code `400` (Bad Request).
  - return the following JSON response: `{ message: "Please provide name and bio for the user" }`.

- If the information about the _user_ is valid:

  - save the new _user_ the the database.
  - respond with HTTP status code `201` (Created).
  - return the newly created _user document_ including its id.

- If there's an error while saving the _user_:
  - respond with HTTP status code `500` (Server Error).
  - return the following JSON object: `{ message: "There was an error while saving the user to the database" }`.

When the client makes a `GET` request to `/api/users`:

- If there's an error in retrieving the _users_ from the database:
  - respond with HTTP status code `500`.
  - return the following JSON object: `{ message: "The users information could not be retrieved" }`.

When the client makes a `GET` request to `/api/users/:id`:

- If the _user_ with the specified `id` is not found:

  - respond with HTTP status code `404` (Not Found).
  - return the following JSON object: `{ message: "The user with the specified ID does not exist" }`.

- If there's an error in retrieving the _user_ from the database:
  - respond with HTTP status code `500`.
  - return the following JSON object: `{ message: "The user information could not be retrieved" }`.

When the client makes a `DELETE` request to `/api/users/:id`:

- If the _user_ with the specified `id` is not found:

  - respond with HTTP status code `404` (Not Found).
  - return the following JSON object: `{ message: "The user with the specified ID does not exist" }`.

- If there's an error in removing the _user_ from the database:
  - respond with HTTP status code `500`.
  - return the following JSON object: `{ message: "The user could not be removed" }`.

When the client makes a `PUT` request to `/api/users/:id`:

- If the _user_ with the specified `id` is not found:

  - respond with HTTP status code `404` (Not Found).
  - return the following JSON object: `{ message: "The user with the specified ID does not exist" }`.

- If the request body is missing the `name` or `bio` property:

  - respond with HTTP status code `400` (Bad Request).
  - return the following JSON response: `{ message: "Please provide name and bio for the user" }`.

- If there's an error when updating the _user_:

  - respond with HTTP status code `500`.
  - return the following JSON object: `{ message: "The user information could not be modified" }`.

- If the user is found and the new information is valid:

  - update the user document in the database using the new information sent in the `request body`.
  - respond with HTTP status code `200` (OK).
  - return the newly updated _user document_.

#### Notes

- You are welcome to create additional files but **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- Do not alter your `package.json` file except to install additional libraries or add additional scripts.
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work.
- Perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work.

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

Be careful not to _break MVP_ while working on these Stretch goals! If in doubt create a new branch.

You'll need to enable the `cors` middleware:

- add the `cors` npm module: `npm i cors`.
- add `server.use(cors())` after `server.use(express.json())`.

Create a new React application and connect it to your server:

- the React application can be anywhere, but, for this project create it inside the folder for the solution.
- connect to the `/api/users` endpoint in the API and show the list of users.
- add a delete button to each displayed user that will remove it from the server.
- add forms to add and update data.
- Style the list of users however you see fit.
